<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">In a council of the Gods, Minerva calls their attention to Ulysses, still
a wanderer. They resolve to grant him a safe return to Ithaca. Minerva
descends to encourage Telemachus, and in the form of Mentes directs him
in what manner to proceed. Throughout this book the extravagance and
profligacy of the suitors are occasionally suggested.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Muse make the man thy theme, for shrewdness famed<br></span>
<span class="i0">And genius versatile, who far and wide<br></span>
<span class="i0">A Wand’rer, after Ilium overthrown,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Discover’d various cities, and the mind<br></span>
<span class="i0">And manners learn’d of men, in lands remote.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He num’rous woes on Ocean toss’d, endured,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Anxious to save himself, and to conduct<br></span>
<span class="i0">His followers to their home; yet all his care<br></span>
<span class="i0">Preserved them not; they perish’d self-destroy’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">By their own fault; infatuate! who devoured <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l10" id="BI_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The oxen of the all-o’erseeing Sun,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, punish’d for that crime, return’d no more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Daughter divine of Jove, these things record,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As it may please thee, even in our ears.<br></span>
<span class="i2">The rest, all those who had perdition ’scaped<br></span>
<span class="i0">By war or on the Deep, dwelt now at home;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Him only, of his country and his wife<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alike desirous, in her hollow grots<br></span>
<span class="i0">Calypso, Goddess beautiful, detained<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wooing him to her arms. But when, at length, <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l20" id="BI_l20"></a>20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">(Many a long year elapsed) the year arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of his return (by the decree of heav’n)<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Ithaca, not even then had he,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Although surrounded by his people, reach’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The period of his suff’rings and his toils.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet all the Gods, with pity moved, beheld<br></span>
<span class="i0">His woes, save Neptune; He alone with wrath<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unceasing and implacable pursued<br></span>
<span class="i0">Godlike Ulysses to his native shores.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But Neptune, now, the Æthiopians fought, <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l30" id="BI_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">(The Æthiopians, utmost of mankind,<br></span>
<span class="i0">These Eastward situate, those toward the West)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Call’d to an hecatomb of bulls and lambs.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There sitting, pleas’d he banqueted; the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">In Jove’s abode, meantime, assembled all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">’Midst whom the Sire of heav’n and earth began.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For he recall’d to mind Ægisthus slain<br></span>
<span class="i0">By Agamemnon’s celebrated son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Orestes, and retracing in his thought<br></span>
<span class="i0">That dread event, the Immortals thus address’d. <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l40" id="BI_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i2">Alas! how prone are human-kind to blame<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Pow’rs of Heav’n! From us, they say, proceed<br></span>
<span class="i0">The ills which they endure, yet more than Fate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Herself inflicts, by their own crimes incur.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So now Ægisthus, by no force constrained<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Destiny, Atrides’ wedded wife<br></span>
<span class="i0">Took to himself, and him at his return<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slew, not unwarn’d of his own dreadful end<br></span>
<span class="i0">By us: for we commanded Hermes down<br></span>
<span class="i0">The watchful Argicide, who bade him fear <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l50" id="BI_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Alike, to slay the King, or woo the Queen.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For that Atrides’ son Orestes, soon<br></span>
<span class="i0">As grown mature, and eager to assume<br></span>
<span class="i0">His sway imperial, should avenge the deed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So Hermes spake, but his advice moved not<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ægisthus, on whose head the whole arrear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of vengeance heap’d, at last, hath therefore fall’n.<br></span>
<span class="i2">Whom answer’d then Pallas cærulean-eyed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh Jove, Saturnian Sire, o’er all supreme!<br></span>
<span class="i0">And well he merited the death he found; <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l60" id="BI_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">So perish all, who shall, like him, offend.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But with a bosom anguish-rent I view<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, hapless Chief! who from his friends<br></span>
<span class="i0">Remote, affliction hath long time endured<br></span>
<span class="i0">In yonder wood-land isle, the central boss<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ocean. That retreat a Goddess holds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Daughter of sapient Atlas, who the abyss<br></span>
<span class="i0">Knows to its bottom, and the pillars high<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself upbears which sep’rate earth from heav’n.<br></span>
<span class="i0">His daughter, there, the sorrowing Chief detains, <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l70" id="BI_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And ever with smooth speech insidious seeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">To wean his heart from Ithaca; meantime<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, happy might he but behold<br></span>
<span class="i0">The smoke ascending from his native land,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Death covets. Canst thou not, Olympian Jove!<br></span>
<span class="i0">At last relent? Hath not Ulysses oft<br></span>
<span class="i0">With victims slain amid Achaia’s fleet<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thee gratified, while yet at Troy he fought?<br></span>
<span class="i0">How hath he then so deep incensed thee, Jove?<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom, the cloud-assembler God replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l80" id="BI_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">What word hath pass’d thy lips, Daughter belov’d?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Can I forget Ulysses? Him forget<br></span>
<span class="i0">So noble, who in wisdom all mankind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Excels, and who hath sacrific’d so oft<br></span>
<span class="i0">To us whose dwelling is the boundless heav’n?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Earth-circling Neptune—He it is whose wrath<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pursues him ceaseless for the Cyclops’ sake<br></span>
<span class="i0">Polypheme, strongest of the giant race,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom of his eye Ulysses hath deprived.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For Him, Thoösa bore, Nymph of the sea <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l90" id="BI_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">From Phorcys sprung, by Ocean’s mighty pow’r<br></span>
<span class="i0">Impregnated in caverns of the Deep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">E’er since that day, the Shaker of the shores,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Although he slay him not, yet devious drives<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses from his native isle afar.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet come—in full assembly his return<br></span>
<span class="i0">Contrive we now, both means and prosp’rous end;<br></span>
<span class="i0">So Neptune shall his wrath remit, whose pow’r<br></span>
<span class="i0">In contest with the force of all the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exerted single, can but strive in vain. <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l100" id="BI_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Minerva, Goddess azure-eyed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh Jupiter! above all Kings enthroned!<br></span>
<span class="i0">If the Immortals ever-blest ordain<br></span>
<span class="i0">That wise Ulysses to his home return,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dispatch we then Hermes the Argicide,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our messenger, hence to Ogygia’s isle,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who shall inform Calypso, nymph divine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of this our fixt resolve, that to his home<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, toil-enduring Chief, repair.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself will hence to Ithaca, meantime, <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l110" id="BI_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His son to animate, and with new force<br></span>
<span class="i0">Inspire, that (the Achaians all convened<br></span>
<span class="i0">In council,) he may, instant, bid depart<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors from his home, who, day by day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His num’rous flocks and fatted herds consume.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I will send him thence to Sparta forth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And into sandy Pylus, there to hear<br></span>
<span class="i0">(If hear he may) some tidings of his Sire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to procure himself a glorious name.<br></span>
<span class="i1">This said, her golden sandals to her feet <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l120" id="BI_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">She bound, ambrosial, which o’er all the earth<br></span>
<span class="i0">And o’er the moist flood waft her fleet as air,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, seizing her strong spear pointed with brass,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In length and bulk, and weight a matchless beam,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With which the Jove-born Goddess levels ranks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Heroes, against whom her anger burns,<br></span>
<span class="i0">From the Olympian summit down she flew,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And on the threshold of Ulysses’ hall<br></span>
<span class="i0">In Ithaca, and within his vestibule<br></span>
<span class="i0">Apparent stood; there, grasping her bright spear, <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l130" id="BI_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Mentes<a name="fnm_1" id="fnm_1"></a><a href="#fn_1" class="fnnum">1</a> she seem’d, the hospitable Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Taphos’ isle—she found the haughty throng<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors; they before the palace gate<br></span>
<span class="i0">With iv’ry cubes sported, on num’rous hides<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reclined of oxen which themselves had slain.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The heralds and the busy menials there<br></span>
<span class="i0">Minister’d to them; these their mantling cups<br></span>
<span class="i0">With water slaked; with bibulous sponges those<br></span>
<span class="i0">Made clean the tables, set the banquet on,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And portioned out to each his plenteous share. <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l140" id="BI_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Long ere the rest Telemachus himself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mark’d her, for sad amid them all he sat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pourtraying in deep thought contemplative<br></span>
<span class="i0">His noble Sire, and questioning if yet<br></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance the Hero might return to chase<br></span>
<span class="i0">From all his palace that imperious herd,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To his own honour lord of his own home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amid them musing thus, sudden he saw<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Goddess, and sprang forth, for he abhorr’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To see a guest’s admittance long delay’d; <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l150" id="BI_l150"></a>150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Approaching eager, her right hand he seized,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The brazen spear took from her, and in words<br></span>
<span class="i0">With welcome wing’d Minerva thus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Stranger, all hail! to share our cordial love<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou com’st; the banquet finish’d, thou shalt next<br></span>
<span class="i0">Inform me wherefore thou hast here arrived.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, toward the spacious hall he moved,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Follow’d by Pallas, and, arriving soon<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the lofty roof, placed her bright spear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within a pillar’s cavity, long time <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l160" id="BI_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The armoury where many a spear had stood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bright weapons of his own illustrious Sire.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, leading her toward a footstool’d throne<br></span>
<span class="i0">Magnificent, which first he overspread<br></span>
<span class="i0">With linen, there he seated her, apart<br></span>
<span class="i0">From that rude throng, and for himself disposed<br></span>
<span class="i0">A throne of various colours at her side,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lest, stunn’d with clamour of the lawless band,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The new-arrived should loth perchance to eat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And that more free he might the stranger’s ear <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l170" id="BI_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With questions of his absent Sire address,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now a maiden charg’d with golden ew’r,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with an argent laver, pouring first<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pure water on their hands, supplied them, next,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With a resplendent table, which the chaste<br></span>
<span class="i0">Directress of the stores furnish’d with bread<br></span>
<span class="i0">And dainties, remnants of the last regale.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, in his turn, the sewer<a name="fnm_2" id="fnm_2"></a><a href="#fn_2" class="fnnum">2</a> with sav’ry meats,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dish after dish, served them, of various kinds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And golden cups beside the chargers placed, <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l180" id="BI_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Which the attendant herald fill’d with wine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long, in rush’d the suitors, and the thrones<br></span>
<span class="i0">And couches occupied, on all whose hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">The heralds pour’d pure water; then the maids<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attended them with bread in baskets heap’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And eager they assail’d the ready feast.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At length, when neither thirst nor hunger more<br></span>
<span class="i0">They felt unsatisfied, to new delights<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their thoughts they turn’d, to song and sprightly dance,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enlivening sequel of the banquet’s joys. <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l190" id="BI_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">An herald, then, to Phemius’ hand consign’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">His beauteous lyre; he through constraint regaled<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors with his song, and while the chords<br></span>
<span class="i0">He struck in prelude to his pleasant strains,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus his head inclining nigh<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Pallas’ ear, lest others should his words<br></span>
<span class="i0">Witness, the blue-eyed Goddess thus bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My inmate and my friend! far from my lips<br></span>
<span class="i0">Be ev’ry word that might displease thine ear!<br></span>
<span class="i0">The song—the harp,—what can they less than charm <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l200" id="BI_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">These wantons? who the bread unpurchased eat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of one whose bones on yonder continent<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lie mould’ring, drench’d by all the show’rs of heaven,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or roll at random in the billowy deep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! could they see him once to his own isle<br></span>
<span class="i0">Restored, both gold and raiment they would wish<br></span>
<span class="i0">Far less, and nimbleness of foot instead.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But He, alas! hath by a wretched fate,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Past question perish’d, and what news soe’er<br></span>
<span class="i0">We hear of his return, kindles no hope <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l210" id="BI_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In us, convinced that he returns no more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But answer undissembling; tell me true;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who art thou? whence? where stands thy city? where<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy father’s mansion? In what kind of ship<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cam’st thou? Why steer’d the mariners their course<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Ithaca, and of what land are they?<br></span>
<span class="i0">For that on foot thou found’st us not, is sure.<br></span>
<span class="i0">This also tell me, hast thou now arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">New to our isle, or wast thou heretofore<br></span>
<span class="i0">My father’s guest? Since many to our house <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l220" id="BI_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Resorted in those happier days, for he<br></span>
<span class="i0">Drew pow’rful to himself the hearts of all.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then Pallas thus, Goddess cærulean-eyed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will with all simplicity of truth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy questions satisfy. Behold in me<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mentes, the offspring of a Chief renown’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">In war, Anchialus; and I rule, myself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">An island race, the Taphians oar-expert.<br></span>
<span class="i0">With ship and mariners I now arrive,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seeking a people of another tongue <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l230" id="BI_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Athwart the gloomy flood, in quest of brass<br></span>
<span class="i0">For which I barter steel, ploughing the waves<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Temesa. My ship beneath the woods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Neïus, at yonder field that skirts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Your city, in the haven Rhethrus rides.<br></span>
<span class="i0">We are hereditary guests; our Sires<br></span>
<span class="i0">Were friends long since; as, when thou seest him next,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Hero old Laertes will avouch,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of whom, I learn, that he frequents no more<br></span>
<span class="i0">The city now, but in sequester’d scenes <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l240" id="BI_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Dwells sorrowful, and by an antient dame<br></span>
<span class="i0">With food and drink supplied oft as he feels<br></span>
<span class="i0">Refreshment needful to him, while he creeps<br></span>
<span class="i0">Between the rows of his luxuriant vines.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But I have come drawn hither by report,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which spake thy Sire arrived, though still it seems<br></span>
<span class="i0">The adverse Gods his homeward course retard.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For not yet breathless lies the noble Chief,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But in some island of the boundless flood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Resides a prisoner, by barbarous force <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l250" id="BI_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of some rude race detained reluctant there.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I will now foreshow thee what the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Teach me, and what, though neither augur skill’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor prophet, I yet trust shall come to pass.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He shall not, henceforth, live an exile long<br></span>
<span class="i0">From his own shores, no, not although in bands<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of iron held, but will ere long contrive<br></span>
<span class="i0">His own return; for in expedients, framed<br></span>
<span class="i0">With wond’rous ingenuity, he abounds.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But tell me true; art thou, in stature such, <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l260" id="BI_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Son of himself Ulysses? for thy face<br></span>
<span class="i0">And eyes bright-sparkling, strongly indicate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses in thee. Frequent have we both<br></span>
<span class="i0">Conversed together thus, thy Sire and I,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ere yet he went to Troy, the mark to which<br></span>
<span class="i0">So many Princes of Achaia steer’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Him since I saw not, nor Ulysses me.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stranger! I tell thee true; my mother’s voice<br></span>
<span class="i0">Affirms me his, but since no mortal knows <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l270" id="BI_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His derivation, I affirm it not.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Would I had been son of some happier Sire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ordain’d in calm possession of his own<br></span>
<span class="i0">To reach the verge of life. But now, report<br></span>
<span class="i0">Proclaims me his, whom I of all mankind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unhappiest deem.—Thy question is resolved.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer thus Pallas blue-eyed return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">From no ignoble race, in future days,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Gods shall prove thee sprung, whom so endow’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With ev’ry grace Penelope hath borne. <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l280" id="BI_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But tell me true. What festival is this?<br></span>
<span class="i0">This throng—whence are they? wherefore hast thou need<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of such a multitude? Behold I here<br></span>
<span class="i0">A banquet, or a nuptial? for these<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meet not by contribution<a name="fnm_3" id="fnm_3"></a><a href="#fn_3" class="fnnum">3</a> to regale,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With such brutality and din they hold<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their riotous banquet! a wise man and good<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arriving, now, among them, at the sight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of such enormities would much be wroth.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom replied Telemachus discrete. <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l290" id="BI_l290"></a>290</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Since, stranger! thou hast ask’d, learn also this.<br></span>
<span class="i0">While yet Ulysses, with his people dwelt,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His presence warranted the hope that here<br></span>
<span class="i0">Virtue should dwell and opulence; but heav’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath cast for us, at length, a diff’rent lot,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he is lost, as never man before.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For I should less lament even his death,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had he among his friends at Ilium fall’n,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or in the arms of his companions died,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Troy’s siege accomplish’d. Then his tomb the Greeks <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l300" id="BI_l300"></a>300</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of ev’ry tribe had built, and for his son,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He had immortal glory atchieved; but now,<br></span>
<span class="i0">By harpies torn inglorious, beyond reach<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of eye or ear he lies; and hath to me<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grief only, and unceasing sighs bequeath’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor mourn I for his sake alone; the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have plann’d for me still many a woe beside;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For all the rulers of the neighbour isles,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Samos, Dulichium, and the forest-crown’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Zacynthus, others also, rulers here <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l310" id="BI_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In craggy Ithaca, my mother seek<br></span>

<span class="i0">But neither she those nuptial rites abhorr’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Refuses absolute, nor yet consents<br></span>
<span class="i0">To end them; they my patrimony waste<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, and will not long spare even me.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom, with deep commiseration pang’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pallas replied. Alas! great need hast thou<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy long absent father to avenge<br></span>
<span class="i0">These num’rous wrongs; for could he now appear <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l320" id="BI_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">There, at yon portal, arm’d with helmet, shield,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And grasping his two spears, such as when first<br></span>
<span class="i0">I saw him drinking joyous at our board,<br></span>
<span class="i0">From Ilus son of Mermeris, who dwelt<br></span>
<span class="i0">In distant Ephyre, just then return’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(For thither also had Ulysses gone<br></span>
<span class="i0">In his swift bark, seeking some pois’nous drug<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wherewith to taint his brazen arrows keen,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which drug through fear of the eternal Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ilus refused him, and my father free <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l330" id="BI_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Gave to him, for he loved him past belief)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Could now, Ulysses, clad in arms as then,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mix with these suitors, short his date of life<br></span>
<span class="i0">To each, and bitter should his nuptials prove.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But these events, whether he shall return<br></span>
<span class="i0">To take just vengeance under his own roof,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or whether not, lie all in the Gods lap.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime I counsel thee, thyself to think<br></span>
<span class="i0">By what means likeliest thou shalt expel<br></span>
<span class="i0">These from thy doors. Now mark me: close attend. <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l340" id="BI_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow, summoning the Grecian Chiefs<br></span>
<span class="i0">To council, speak to them, and call the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">To witness that solemnity. Bid go<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors hence, each to his own abode.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy mother—if her purpose be resolved<br></span>
<span class="i0">On marriage, let her to the house return<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of her own potent father, who, himself,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Perchance, by Jove directed (safest source<br></span>

<span class="i0">First voyaging to Pylus, there enquire<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of noble Nestor; thence to Sparta tend,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Latest arrived of all the host of Greece.<br></span>

<span class="i0">But should’st thou there hear tidings that he breathes<br></span>
<span class="i0">No longer, to thy native isle return’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">First heap his tomb; then with such pomp perform<br></span>
<span class="i0">His funeral rites as his great name demands,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Whether thou shalt these troublers of thy house<br></span>
<span class="i0">By stratagem, or by assault, destroy.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For thou art now no child, nor longer may’st<br></span>

<span class="i0">With all mankind, his father’s murtherer<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ægisthus slaying, the deceiver base<br></span>

<span class="i0">But I will to my vessel now repair,<br></span>

<span class="i0">I may perchance have troubled. Weigh thou well<br></span>
<span class="i0">My counsel; let not my advice be lost.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Telemachus discrete replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stranger! thy words bespeak thee much my friend,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, as a father teaches his own son,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hast taught me, and I never will forget.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, though in haste thy voyage to pursue, <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l390" id="BI_l390"></a>390</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet stay, that in the bath refreshing first<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy limbs now weary, thou may’st sprightlier seek<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy gallant bark, charged with some noble gift<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of finish’d workmanship, which thou shalt keep<br></span>
<span class="i0">As my memorial ever; such a boon<br></span>
<span class="i0">As men confer on guests whom much they love.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then Pallas thus, Goddess cærulean-eyed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Retard me not, for go I must; the gift<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which liberal thou desirest to bestow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Give me at my return, that I may bear <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l400" id="BI_l400"></a>400</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The treasure home; and, in exchange, thyself<br></span>

<span class="i1">She spake, and as with eagle-wings upborne,<br></span>

<span class="i0">With daring fortitude, and on his heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dearer remembrance of his Sire impress’d<br></span>

<span class="i0">Amazed he stood, and, in his secret thought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Revolving all, believed his guest a God.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The youthful Hero to the suitors then <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l410" id="BI_l410"></a>410</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Repair’d; they silent, listen’d to the song<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the illustrious Bard: he the return<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deplorable of the Achaian host<br></span>
<span class="i0">From Ilium by command of Pallas, sang.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Penelope, Icarius’ daughter, mark’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the song celestial, where she sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">In the superior palace; down she came,<br></span>
<span class="i0">By all the num’rous steps of her abode;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not sole, for two fair handmaids follow’d her.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She then, divinest of her sex, arrived <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l420" id="BI_l420"></a>420</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In presence of that lawless throng, beneath<br></span>
<span class="i0">The portal of her stately mansion stood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Between her maidens, with her lucid veil<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her lovely features mantling. There, profuse<br></span>
<span class="i0">She wept, and thus the sacred bard bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Phemius! for many a sorrow-soothing strain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou know’st beside, such as exploits record<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Gods and men, the poet’s frequent theme;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Give them of those a song, and let themselves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their wine drink noiseless; but this mournful strain <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l430" id="BI_l430"></a>430</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Break off, unfriendly to my bosom’s peace,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Rememb’ring still an husband praised from side<br></span>
<span class="i0">To side, and in the very heart of Greece.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer thus Telemachus return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My mother! wherefore should it give thee pain<br></span>
<span class="i0">If the delightful bard that theme pursue<br></span>
<span class="i0">To which he feels his mind impell’d? the bard<br></span>
<span class="i0">Blame not, but rather Jove, who, as he wills, <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l440" id="BI_l440"></a>440</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Materials for poetic art supplies.<br></span>
<span class="i0">No fault is his, if the disastrous fate<br></span>
<span class="i0">He sing of the Achaians, for the song<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wins ever from the hearers most applause<br></span>
<span class="i0">That has been least in use. Of all who fought<br></span>
<span class="i0">At Troy, Ulysses hath not lost, alone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His day of glad return; but many a Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath perish’d also. Seek thou then again<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy own apartment, spindle ply and loom,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And task thy maidens; management belongs <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l450" id="BI_l450"></a>450</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To men of joys convivial, and of men<br></span>
<span class="i0">Especially to me, chief ruler here.<br></span>
<span class="i1">She heard astonish’d; and the prudent speech<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reposing of her son deep in her heart,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Again with her attendant maidens sought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her upper chamber. There arrived, she wept<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her lost Ulysses, till Minerva bathed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her weary lids in dewy sleep profound.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then echoed through the palace dark-bedimm’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With evening shades the suitors boist’rous roar, <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l460" id="BI_l460"></a>460</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For each the royal bed burn’d to partake,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom thus Telemachus discrete address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">All ye my mother’s suitors, though addict<br></span>
<span class="i0">To contumacious wrangling fierce, suspend<br></span>
<span class="i0">Your clamour, for a course to me it seems<br></span>
<span class="i0">More decent far, when such a bard as this,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Godlike, for sweetness, sings, to hear his song.<br></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow meet we in full council all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That I may plainly warn you to depart<br></span>
<span class="i0">From this our mansion. Seek ye where ye may <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l470" id="BI_l470"></a>470</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Your feasts; consume your own; alternate feed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Each at the other’s cost; but if it seem<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wisest in your account and best, to eat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Voracious thus the patrimonial goods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of one man, rend’ring no account of all,<a name="fnm_5" id="fnm_5"></a><a href="#fn_5" class="fnnum">5</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">Bite to the roots; but know that I will cry<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ceaseless to the eternal Gods, in hope<br></span>
<span class="i0">That Jove, for retribution of the wrong,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall doom you, where ye have intruded, there<br></span>
<span class="i0">To bleed, and of your blood ask no account.<a href="#fn_5" class="fnnum">5</a> <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l480" id="BI_l480"></a>480</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, and each gnaw’d his lip, aghast<br></span>
<span class="i0">At his undaunted hardiness of speech.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then thus Antinoüs spake, Eupithes’ son.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus! the Gods, methinks, themselves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Teach thee sublimity, and to pronounce<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy matter fearless. Ah forbid it, Jove!<br></span>
<span class="i0">That one so eloquent should with the weight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of kingly cares in Ithaca be charged,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A realm, by claim hereditary, thine.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then prudent thus Telemachus replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l490" id="BI_l490"></a>490</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Although my speech Antinoüs may, perchance,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Provoke thee, know that I am not averse<br></span>
<span class="i0">From kingly cares, if Jove appoint me such.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seems it to thee a burthen to be fear’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">By men above all others? trust me, no,<br></span>
<span class="i0">There is no ill in royalty; the man<br></span>
<span class="i0">So station’d, waits not long ere he obtain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Riches and honour. But I grant that Kings<br></span>

<span class="i0">In sea-girt Ithaca both young and old, <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l500" id="BI_l500"></a>500</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of whom since great Ulysses is no more,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reign whoso may; but King, myself, I am<br></span>
<span class="i0">In my own house, and over all my own<br></span>
<span class="i0">Domestics, by Ulysses gained for me.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Eurymachus replied, the son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Polybus. What Grecian Chief shall reign<br></span>
<span class="i0">In sea-girt Ithaca, must be referr’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the Gods’ will, Telemachus! meantime<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast unquestionable right to keep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy own, and to command in thy own house. <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l510" id="BI_l510"></a>510</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">May never that man on her shores arrive,<br></span>
<span class="i0">While an inhabitant shall yet be left<br></span>
<span class="i0">In Ithaca, who shall by violence wrest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thine from thee. But permit me, noble Sir!<br></span>
<span class="i0">To ask thee of thy guest. Whence came the man?<br></span>
<span class="i0">What country claims him? Where are to be found<br></span>
<span class="i0">His kindred and his patrimonial fields?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Brings he glad tidings of thy Sire’s approach<br></span>
<span class="i0">Homeward? or came he to receive a debt<br></span>
<span class="i0">Due to himself? How swift he disappear’d! <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l520" id="BI_l520"></a>520</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor opportunity to know him gave<br></span>
<span class="i0">To those who wish’d it; for his face and air<br></span>
<span class="i0">Him speak not of Plebeian birth obscure.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Whom answered thus Telemachus discrete.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eurymachus! my father comes no more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I can no longer now tidings believe,<br></span>
<span class="i0">If such arrive; nor he’d I more the song<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of sooth-sayers whom my mother may consult.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But this my guest hath known in other days<br></span>
<span class="i0">My father, and he came from Taphos, son <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l530" id="BI_l530"></a>530</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of brave Anchialus, Mentes by name,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Chief of the sea-practis’d Taphian race.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake Telemachus, but in his heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">Knew well his guest a Goddess from the skies.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then they to dance and heart-enlivening song<br></span>
<span class="i0">Turn’d joyous, waiting the approach of eve,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And dusky evening found them joyous still.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then each, to his own house retiring, sought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Needful repose. Meantime Telemachus<br></span>
<span class="i0">To his own lofty chamber, built in view <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l540" id="BI_l540"></a>540</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the wide hall, retired; but with a heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">In various musings occupied intense.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sage Euryclea, bearing in each hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">A torch, preceded him; her sire was Ops,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pisenor’s son, and, in her early prime,<br></span>
<span class="i0">At his own cost Laertes made her his,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Paying with twenty beeves her purchase-price,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor in less honour than his spotless wife<br></span>
<span class="i0">He held her ever, but his consort’s wrath<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fearing, at no time call’d her to his bed. <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l550" id="BI_l550"></a>550</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">She bore the torches, and with truer heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">Loved him than any of the female train,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For she had nurs’d him in his infant years.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He open’d his broad chamber-valves, and sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">On his couch-side: then putting off his vest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of softest texture, placed it in the hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the attendant dame discrete, who first<br></span>
<span class="i0">Folding it with exactest care, beside<br></span>
<span class="i0">His bed suspended it, and, going forth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Drew by its silver ring the portal close, <span class="linenum"><a name="BI_l560" id="BI_l560"></a>560</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And fasten’d it with bolt and brace secure.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There lay Telemachus, on finest wool<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reposed, contemplating all night his course<br></span>
<span class="i0">Prescribed by Pallas to the Pylian shore.<br></span>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">Telemachus having convened an assembly of the Greecians, publicly calls
on the Suitors to relinquish the house of Ulysses. During the continuance
of the Council he has much to suffer from the petulance of the Suitors,
from whom, having informed them of his design to undertake a voyage in
hope to obtain news of Ulysses, he asks a ship, with all things necessary
for the purpose. He is refused, but is afterwards furnished with what he
wants by Minerva, in the form of Mentor. He embarks in the evening
without the privity of his mother, and the Goddess sails with him.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Aurora, rosy daughter of the dawn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now ting’d the East, when habited again,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Athwart his back his faulchion keen he flung,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His sandals bound to his unsullied feet,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, godlike, issued from his chamber-door.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At once the clear-voic’d heralds he enjoin’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To call the Greeks to council; they aloud<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gave forth the summons, and the throng began.<br></span>
<span class="i0">When all were gather’d, and the assembly full, <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l10" id="BII_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself, his hand arm’d with a brazen spear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Went also; nor alone he went; his hounds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fleet-footed follow’d him, a faithful pair.<br></span>
<span class="i0">O’er all his form Minerva largely shed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Majestic grace divine, and, as he went,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The whole admiring concourse gaz’d on him,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The seniors gave him place, and down he sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">On his paternal Throne. Then grave arose<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Hero, old Ægyptius; bow’d with age<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was he, and by experience deep-inform’d. <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l20" id="BII_l20"></a>20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His son had with Ulysses, godlike Chief,<br></span>
<span class="i0">On board his fleet to steed-fam’d Ilium gone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The warrior Antiphus, whom in his cave<br></span>
<span class="i0">The savage Cyclops slew, and on his flesh<br></span>
<span class="i0">At ev’ning made obscene his last regale.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Three sons he had beside, a suitor one,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eurynomus; the other two, employ<br></span>
<span class="i0">Found constant managing their Sire’s concerns.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he forgat not, father as he was<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of these, his absent eldest, whom he mourn’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l30" id="BII_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ceaseless, and thus his speech, weeping, began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Hear me, ye men of Ithaca, my friends!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor council here nor session hath been held<br></span>
<span class="i0">Since great Ulysses left his native shore.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who now convenes us? what especial need<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath urged him, whether of our youth he be,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or of our senators by age matured?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have tidings reach’d him of our host’s return,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which here he would divulge? or brings he aught<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of public import on a diff’rent theme? <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l40" id="BII_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I deem him, whosoe’er he be, a man<br></span>
<span class="i0">Worthy to prosper, and may Jove vouchsafe<br></span>
<span class="i0">The full performance of his chief desire!<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, and Telemachus rejoiced<br></span>
<span class="i0">In that good omen. Ardent to begin,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He sat not long, but, moving to the midst,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Received the sceptre from Pisenor’s hand,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His prudent herald, and addressing, next,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The hoary Chief Ægyptius, thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Not far remote, as thou shalt soon thyself <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l50" id="BII_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Perceive, oh venerable Chief! he stands,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who hath convened this council. I, am He.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I am in chief the suff’rer. Tidings none<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the returning host I have received,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which here I would divulge, nor bring I aught<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of public import on a different theme,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But my own trouble, on my own house fall’n,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And two-fold fall’n. One is, that I have lost<br></span>
<span class="i0">A noble father, who, as fathers rule<br></span>
<span class="i0">Benign their children, govern’d once yourselves; <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l60" id="BII_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The other, and the more alarming ill,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With ruin threatens my whole house, and all<br></span>
<span class="i0">My patrimony with immediate waste.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Suitors, (their children who in this our isle<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hold highest rank) importunate besiege<br></span>
<span class="i0">My mother, though desirous not to wed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And rather than resort to her own Sire<br></span>
<span class="i0">Icarius, who might give his daughter dow’r,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And portion her to whom he most approves,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(A course which, only named, moves their disgust) <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l70" id="BII_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">They chuse, assembling all within my gates<br></span>
<span class="i0">Daily to make my beeves, my sheep, my goats<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their banquet, and to drink without restraint<br></span>
<span class="i0">My wine; whence ruin threatens us and ours;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For I have no Ulysses to relieve<br></span>
<span class="i0">Me and my family from this abuse.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ourselves are not sufficient; we, alas!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Too feeble should be found, and yet to learn<br></span>
<span class="i0">How best to use the little force we own;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Else, had I pow’r, I would, myself, redress <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l80" id="BII_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The evil; for it now surpasses far<br></span>
<span class="i0">All suff’rance, now they ravage uncontroul’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor show of decency vouchsafe me more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh be ashamed<a name="fnm_6" id="fnm_6"></a><a href="#fn_6" class="fnnum">6</a> yourselves; blush at the thought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of such reproach as ye shall sure incur<br></span>
<span class="i0">From all our neighbour states, and fear beside<br></span>
<span class="i0">The wrath of the Immortals, lest they call<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yourselves one day to a severe account.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I pray you by Olympian Jove, by her<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose voice convenes all councils, and again <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l90" id="BII_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Dissolves them, Themis, that henceforth ye cease,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That ye permit me, oh my friends! to wear<br></span>
<span class="i0">My days in solitary grief away,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unless Ulysses, my illustrious Sire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath in his anger any Greecian wrong’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose wrongs ye purpose to avenge on me,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Inciting these to plague me. Better far<br></span>
<span class="i0">Were my condition, if yourselves consumed<br></span>
<span class="i0">My substance and my revenue; from you<br></span>
<span class="i0">I might obtain, perchance, righteous amends <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l100" id="BII_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Hereafter; you I might with vehement suit<br></span>
<span class="i0">O’ercome, from house to house pleading aloud<br></span>
<span class="i0">For recompense, till I at last prevail’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But now, with darts of anguish ye transfix<br></span>
<span class="i0">My inmost soul, and I have no redress.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake impassion’d, and to earth cast down<br></span>
<span class="i0">His sceptre, weeping. Pity at that sight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seiz’d all the people; mute the assembly sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Long time, none dared to greet Telemachus<br></span>
<span class="i0">With answer rough, till of them all, at last, <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l110" id="BII_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Antinoüs, sole arising, thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Telemachus, intemp’rate in harangue,<br></span>
<span class="i0">High-sounding orator! it is thy drift<br></span>
<span class="i0">To make us all odious; but the offence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lies not with us the suitors; she alone<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy mother, who in subtlety excels,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And deep-wrought subterfuge, deserves the blame.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It is already the third year, and soon<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall be the fourth, since with delusive art<br></span>
<span class="i0">Practising on their minds, she hath deceived <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l120" id="BII_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The Greecians; message after message sent<br></span>
<span class="i0">Brings hope to each, by turns, and promise fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But she, meantime, far otherwise intends.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her other arts exhausted all, she framed<br></span>
<span class="i0">This stratagem; a web of amplest size<br></span>
<span class="i0">And subtlest woof beginning, thus she spake.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Princes, my suitors! since the noble Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses is no more, press not as yet<br></span>
<span class="i0">My nuptials, wait till I shall finish, first,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A fun’ral robe (lest all my threads decay) <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l130" id="BII_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Which for the antient Hero I prepare,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laertes, looking for the mournful hour<br></span>
<span class="i0">When fate shall snatch him to eternal rest;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Else I the censure dread of all my sex,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should he, so wealthy, want at last a shroud.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So spake the Queen, and unsuspicious, we<br></span>
<span class="i0">With her request complied. Thenceforth, all day<br></span>
<span class="i0">She wove the ample web, and by the aid<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of torches ravell’d it again at night.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Three years by such contrivance she deceived <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l140" id="BII_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The Greecians; but when (three whole years elaps’d)<br></span>
<span class="i0">The fourth arriv’d, then, conscious of the fraud,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A damsel of her train told all the truth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And her we found rav’ling the beauteous work.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, through necessity she hath, at length,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Perform’d the task, and in her own despight.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now therefore, for the information clear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of thee thyself, and of the other Greeks,<br></span>
<span class="i0">We answer. Send thy mother hence, with charge<br></span>
<span class="i0">That him she wed on whom her father’s choice <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l150" id="BII_l150"></a>150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall fall, and whom she shall, herself, approve.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But if by long procrastination still<br></span>
<span class="i0">She persevere wearing our patience out,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attentive only to display the gifts<br></span>
<span class="i0">By Pallas so profusely dealt to her,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Works of surpassing skill, ingenious thought,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And subtle shifts, such as no beauteous Greek<br></span>
<span class="i0">(For aught that we have heard) in antient times<br></span>
<span class="i0">E’er practised, Tyro, or Alcemena fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or fair Mycene, of whom none in art <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l160" id="BII_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">E’er match’d Penelope, although we yield<br></span>
<span class="i0">To this her last invention little praise,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then know, that these her suitors will consume<br></span>
<span class="i0">So long thy patrimony and thy goods,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As she her present purpose shall indulge,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With which the Gods inspire her. Great renown<br></span>
<span class="i0">She to herself insures, but equal woe<br></span>
<span class="i0">And devastation of thy wealth to thee;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For neither to our proper works at home<br></span>
<span class="i0">Go we, of that be sure, nor yet elsewhere, <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l170" id="BII_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Till him she wed, to whom she most inclines.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him prudent, then, answer’d Telemachus.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Antinoüs! it is not possible<br></span>
<span class="i0">That I should thrust her forth against her will,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who both produced and reared me. Be he dead,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or still alive, my Sire is far remote,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And should I, voluntary, hence dismiss<br></span>
<span class="i0">My mother to Icarius, I must much<br></span>
<span class="i0">Refund, which hardship were and loss to me.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So doing, I should also wrath incur <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l180" id="BII_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">From my offended Sire, and from the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Still more; for she, departing, would invoke<br></span>
<span class="i0">Erynnis to avenge her, and reproach<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside would follow me from all mankind.<br></span>
<span class="i0">That word I, therefore, never will pronounce.<br></span>
<span class="i0">No, if ye judge your treatment at her hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">Injurious to you, go ye forth yourselves,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forsake my mansion; seek where else ye may<br></span>
<span class="i0">Your feasts; consume your own; alternate feed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Each at the other’s cost. But if it seem <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l190" id="BII_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Wisest in your account and best to eat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Voracious thus the patrimonial goods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of one man, rend’ring no account of all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bite to the roots; but know that I will cry<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ceaseless to the eternal Gods, in hope<br></span>
<span class="i0">That Jove, in retribution of the wrong,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall doom you, where ye have intruded, there<br></span>
<span class="i0">To bleed, and of your blood ask no account.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake Telemachus, and while he spake,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Thund’rer from a lofty mountain-top <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l200" id="BII_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Turn’d off two eagles; on the winds, awhile,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With outspread pinions ample side by side<br></span>
<span class="i0">They floated; but, ere long, hov’ring aloft,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Right o’er the midst of the assembled Chiefs<br></span>
<span class="i0">They wheel’d around, clang’d all their num’rous plumes,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with a downward look eyeing the throng,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Death boded, ominous; then rending each<br></span>
<span class="i0">The other’s face and neck, they sprang at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">Toward the right, and darted through the town.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amazement universal, at that sight, <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l210" id="BII_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Seized the assembly, and with anxious thought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Each scann’d the future; amidst whom arose<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Hero Halitherses, antient Seer,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Offspring of Mastor; for in judgment he<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of portents augural, and in forecast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unerring, his coevals all excell’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And prudent thus the multitude bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ye men of Ithaca, give ear! hear all!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Though chief my speech shall to the suitors look,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For, on their heads devolved, comes down the woe. <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l220" id="BII_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses shall not from his friends, henceforth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Live absent long, but, hasting to his home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Comes even now, and as he comes, designs<br></span>
<span class="i0">A bloody death for these, whose bitter woes<br></span>
<span class="i0">No few shall share, inhabitants with us<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of pleasant Ithaca; but let us frame<br></span>
<span class="i0">Effectual means maturely to suppress<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their violent deeds, or rather let themselves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Repentant cease; and soonest shall be best.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not inexpert, but well-inform’d I speak <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l230" id="BII_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The future, and the accomplishment announce<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all which when Ulysses with the Greeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Embark’d for Troy, I to himself foretold.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I said that, after many woes, and loss<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all his people, in the twentieth year,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unknown to all, he should regain his home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And my prediction shall be now fulfill’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him, then, Eurymachus thus answer’d rough<br></span>
<span class="i0">The son of Polybus. Hence to thy house,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hoary dotard! there, prophetic, teach <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l240" id="BII_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy children to escape woes else to come.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Birds num’rous flutter in the beams of day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not all predictive. Death, far hence remote<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath found Ulysses, and I would to heav’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">That, where he died, thyself had perish’d too.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hadst not then run o’er with prophecy<br></span>
<span class="i0">As now, nor provocation to the wrath<br></span>
<span class="i0">Giv’n of Telemachus, in hope to win,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance, for thine some favour at his hands.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But I to <i>thee</i> foretell, skilled as thou art <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l250" id="BII_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In legends old, (nor shall my threat be vain)<br></span>
<span class="i0">That if by artifice thou move to wrath<br></span>
<span class="i0">A younger than thyself, no matter whom,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Woe first the heavier on himself shall fall,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor shalt thou profit him by thy attempt,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And we will charge thee also with a mulct,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which thou shalt pay with difficulty, and bear<br></span>
<span class="i0">The burthen of it with an aching heart.<br></span>
<span class="i1">As for Telemachus, I him advise,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself, and press the measure on his choice <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l260" id="BII_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Earnestly, that he send his mother hence<br></span>
<span class="i0">To her own father’s house, who shall, himself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Set forth her nuptial rites, and shall endow<br></span>
<span class="i0">His daughter sumptuously, and as he ought.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For this expensive wooing, as I judge,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till then shall never cease; since we regard<br></span>
<span class="i0">No man—no—not Telemachus, although<br></span>
<span class="i0">In words exub’rant; neither fear we aught<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy vain prognostics, venerable sir!<br></span>
<span class="i0">But only hate thee for their sake the more. <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l270" id="BII_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Waste will continue and disorder foul<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unremedied, so long as she shall hold<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors in suspense, for, day by day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our emulation goads us to the strife,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor shall we, going hence, seek to espouse<br></span>
<span class="i0">Each his own comfort suitable elsewhere.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom, discrete, Telemachus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eurymachus, and ye the suitor train<br></span>
<span class="i0">Illustrious, I have spoken: ye shall hear<br></span>
<span class="i0">No more this supplication urged by me. <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l280" id="BII_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The Gods, and all the Greeks, now know the truth.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But give me instantly a gallant bark<br></span>
<span class="i0">With twenty rowers, skill’d their course to win<br></span>
<span class="i0">To whatsoever haven; for I go<br></span>
<span class="i0">To sandy Pylus, and shall hasten thence<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Lacedemon, tidings to obtain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of my long-absent Sire, or from the lips<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of man, or by a word from Jove vouchsafed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself, best source of notice to mankind.<br></span>
<span class="i0">If, there inform’d that still my father lives, <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l290" id="BII_l290"></a>290</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I hope conceive of his return, although<br></span>
<span class="i0">Distress’d, I shall be patient yet a year.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But should I learn, haply, that he survives<br></span>
<span class="i0">No longer, then, returning, I will raise<br></span>
<span class="i0">At home his tomb, will with such pomp perform<br></span>
<span class="i0">His fun’ral rites, as his great name demands,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And give my mother’s hand to whom I may.<br></span>
<span class="i1">This said, he sat, and after him arose<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mentor, illustrious Ulysses’ friend,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To whom, embarking thence, he had consign’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l300" id="BII_l300"></a>300</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">All his concerns, that the old Chief might rule<br></span>
<span class="i0">His family, and keep the whole secure.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arising, thus the senior, sage, began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Hear me, ye Ithacans! be never King<br></span>
<span class="i0">Henceforth, benevolent, gracious, humane<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or righteous, but let every sceptred hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rule merciless, and deal in wrong alone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Since none of all his people, whom he sway’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With such paternal gentleness and love,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Remembers the divine Ulysses more! <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l310" id="BII_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That the imperious suitors thus should weave<br></span>
<span class="i0">The web of mischief and atrocious wrong,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I grudge not; since at hazard of their heads<br></span>
<span class="i0">They make Ulysses’ property a prey,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Persuaded that the Hero comes no more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But much the people move me; how ye sit<br></span>
<span class="i0">All mute, and though a multitude, yourselves,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Opposed to few, risque not a single word<br></span>
<span class="i0">To check the license of these bold intruders!<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then thus Liocritus, Evenor’s son. <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l320" id="BII_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Injurious Mentor! headlong orator!<br></span>
<span class="i0">How dar’st thou move the populace against<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors? Trust me they should find it hard,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Numerous as they are, to cope with us,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A feast the prize. Or should the King himself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ithaca, returning, undertake<br></span>
<span class="i0">T’ expell the jovial suitors from his house,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Much as Penelope his absence mourns,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His presence should afford her little joy;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For fighting sole with many, he should meet <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l330" id="BII_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A dreadful death. Thou, therefore, speak’st amiss.<br></span>
<span class="i0">As for Telemachus, let Mentor him<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Halytherses furnish forth, the friends<br></span>
<span class="i0">Long valued of his Sire, with all dispatch;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Though him I judge far likelier to remain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Long-time contented an enquirer here,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Than to perform the voyage now proposed.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus saying, Liocritus dissolved in haste<br></span>
<span class="i0">The council, and the scattered concourse sought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their sev’ral homes, while all the suitors flock’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l340" id="BII_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thence to the palace of their absent King.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, Telemachus from all resort<br></span>
<span class="i0">Retiring, in the surf of the gray Deep<br></span>
<span class="i0">First laved his hands, then, thus to Pallas pray’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">O Goddess! who wast yesterday a guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath my roof, and didst enjoin me then<br></span>
<span class="i0">A voyage o’er the sable Deep in quest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of tidings of my long regretted Sire!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which voyage, all in Ithaca, but most<br></span>
<span class="i0">The haughty suitors, obstinate impede, <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l350" id="BII_l350"></a>350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Now hear my suit and gracious interpose!<br></span>
<span class="i1">Such pray’r he made; then Pallas, in the form,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with the voice of Mentor, drawing nigh,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In accents wing’d, him kindly thus bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Telemachus! thou shalt hereafter prove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor base, nor poor in talents. If, in truth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou have received from heav’n thy father’s force<br></span>
<span class="i0">Instill’d into thee, and resemblest him<br></span>
<span class="i0">In promptness both of action and of speech,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy voyage shall not useless be, or vain. <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l360" id="BII_l360"></a>360</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But if Penelope produced thee not<br></span>
<span class="i0">His son, I, then, hope not for good effect<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of this design which, ardent, thou pursuest.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Few sons their fathers equal; most appear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Degenerate; but we find, though rare, sometimes<br></span>
<span class="i0">A son superior even to his Sire.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And since thyself shalt neither base be found<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor spiritless, nor altogether void<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of talents, such as grace thy royal Sire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I therefore hope success of thy attempt. <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l370" id="BII_l370"></a>370</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Heed not the suitors’ projects; neither wise<br></span>
<span class="i0">Are they, nor just, nor aught suspect the doom<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which now approaches them, and in one day<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall overwhelm them all. No long suspense<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall hold thy purposed enterprise in doubt,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such help from me, of old thy father’s friend,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt receive, who with a bark well-oar’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will serve thee, and myself attend thee forth.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But haste, join thou the suitors, and provide,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In sep’rate vessels stow’d, all needful stores, <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l380" id="BII_l380"></a>380</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Wine in thy jars, and flour, the strength of man,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In skins close-seam’d. I will, meantime, select<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such as shall voluntary share thy toils.<br></span>
<span class="i0">In sea-girt Ithaca new ships and old<br></span>
<span class="i0">Abound, and I will chuse, myself, for thee<br></span>
<span class="i0">The prime of all, which without more delay<br></span>
<span class="i0">We will launch out into the spacious Deep.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus Pallas spake, daughter of Jove; nor long,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So greeted by the voice divine, remain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus, but to his palace went <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l390" id="BII_l390"></a>390</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Distress’d in heart. He found the suitors there<br></span>
<span class="i0">Goats slaying in the hall, and fatted swine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Roasting; when with a laugh Antinoüs flew<br></span>
<span class="i0">To meet him, fasten’d on his hand, and said,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Telemachus, in eloquence sublime,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And of a spirit not to be controul’d!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Give harbour in thy breast on no account<br></span>
<span class="i0">To after-grudge or enmity, but eat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Far rather, cheerfully as heretofore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And freely drink, committing all thy cares <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l400" id="BII_l400"></a>400</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To the Achaians, who shall furnish forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">A gallant ship and chosen crew for thee,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That thou may’st hence to Pylus with all speed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tidings to learn of thy illustrious Sire.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Antinoüs! I have no heart to feast<br></span>
<span class="i0">With guests so insolent, nor can indulge<br></span>
<span class="i0">The pleasures of a mind at ease, with you.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is’t not enough, suitors, that ye have used<br></span>
<span class="i0">My noble patrimony as your own <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l410" id="BII_l410"></a>410</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">While I was yet a child? now, grown mature,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And competent to understand the speech<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of my instructors, feeling, too, a mind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within me conscious of augmented pow’rs,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will attempt your ruin, be assured,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whether at Pylus, or continuing here.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I go, indeed, (nor shall my voyage prove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of which I speak, bootless or vain) I go<br></span>
<span class="i0">An humble passenger, who neither bark<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor rowers have to boast my own, denied <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l420" id="BII_l420"></a>420</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That honour (so ye judg’d it best) by you.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and from Antinoüs’ hand his own<br></span>
<span class="i0">Drew sudden. Then their delicate repast<br></span>
<span class="i0">The busy suitors on all sides prepar’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Still taunting as they toil’d, and with sharp speech<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sarcastic wantoning, of whom a youth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arrogant as his fellows, thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">I see it plain, Telemachus intends<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our slaughter; either he will aids procure<br></span>
<span class="i0">From sandy Pylus, or will bring them arm’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l430" id="BII_l430"></a>430</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">From Sparta; such is his tremendous drift.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Even to fruitful Ephyre, perchance,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He will proceed, seeking some baneful herb<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which cast into our cup, shall drug us all.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom some haughty suitor thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who knows but that himself, wand’ring the sea<br></span>
<span class="i0">From all his friends and kindred far remote,<br></span>
<span class="i0">May perish like Ulysses? Whence to us<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should double toil ensue, on whom the charge<br></span>
<span class="i0">To parcel out his wealth would then devolve, <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l440" id="BII_l440"></a>440</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And to endow his mother with the house<br></span>
<span class="i0">For his abode whom she should chance to wed.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So sported they; but he, ascending sought<br></span>
<span class="i0">His father’s lofty chamber, where his heaps<br></span>
<span class="i0">He kept of brass and gold, garments in chests,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And oils of fragrant scent, a copious store.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There many a cask with season’d nectar fill’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The grape’s pure juice divine, beside the wall<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stood orderly arranged, waiting the hour<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Should e’er such hour arrive) when, after woes <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l450" id="BII_l450"></a>450</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Num’rous, Ulysses should regain his home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Secure that chamber was with folding doors<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of massy planks compact, and night and day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within it antient Euryclea dwelt,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Guardian discrete of all the treasures there,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom, thither call’d, Telemachus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Nurse! draw me forth sweet wine into my jars,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Delicious next to that which thou reserv’st<br></span>
<span class="i0">For our poor wand’rer; if escaping death<br></span>
<span class="i0">At last, divine Ulysses e’er return. <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l460" id="BII_l460"></a>460</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Fill twelve, and stop them close; pour also meal<br></span>
<span class="i0">Well mill’d (full twenty measures) into skins<br></span>
<span class="i0">Close-seam’d, and mention what thou dost to none.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Place them together; for at even-tide<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will convey them hence, soon as the Queen,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Retiring to her couch, shall seek repose.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For hence to Sparta will I take my course,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And sandy Pylus, tidings there to hear<br></span>
<span class="i0">(If hear I may) of my lov’d Sire’s return.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He ceas’d, then wept his gentle nurse that sound <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l470" id="BII_l470"></a>470</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Hearing, and in wing’d accents thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My child! ah, wherefore hath a thought so rash<br></span>
<span class="i0">Possess’d thee? whither, only and belov’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seek’st thou to ramble, travelling, alas!<br></span>
<span class="i0">To distant climes? Ulysses is no more;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dead lies the Hero in some land unknown,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thou no sooner shalt depart, than these<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will plot to slay thee, and divide thy wealth.<br></span>
<span class="i0">No, stay with us who love thee. Need is none<br></span>
<span class="i0">That thou should’st on the barren Deep distress <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l480" id="BII_l480"></a>480</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Encounter, roaming without hope or end.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Whom, prudent, thus answer’d Telemachus.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Take courage, nurse! for not without consent<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Immortals I have thus resolv’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But swear, that till eleven days be past,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or twelve, or, till enquiry made, she learn<br></span>
<span class="i0">Herself my going, thou wilt not impart<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of this my purpose to my mother’s ear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lest all her beauties fade by grief impair’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, and the antient matron swore <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l490" id="BII_l490"></a>490</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Solemnly by the Gods; which done, she fill’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With wine the vessels and the skins with meal,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he, returning, join’d the throng below.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then Pallas, Goddess azure-eyed, her thoughts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Elsewhere directing, all the city ranged<br></span>
<span class="i0">In semblance of Telemachus, each man<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exhorting, at the dusk of eve, to seek<br></span>
<span class="i0">The gallant ship, and from Noëmon, son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Renown’d of Phronius, ask’d, herself, a bark,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which soon as ask’d, he promis’d to supply. <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l500" id="BII_l500"></a>500</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Now set the sun, and twilight dimm’d the ways,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When, drawing down his bark into the Deep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He gave her all her furniture, oars, arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">And tackle, such as well-built galleys bear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then moor’d her in the bottom of the bay.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, his mariners in haste repair’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Down to the shore, for Pallas urged them on.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now on other purposes intent,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Goddess sought the palace, where with dews<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of slumber drenching ev’ry suitor’s eye, <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l510" id="BII_l510"></a>510</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">She fool’d the drunkard multitude, and dash’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The goblets from their idle hands away.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They through the city reeled, happy to leave<br></span>
<span class="i0">The dull carousal, when the slumb’rous weight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oppressive on their eye-lids once had fall’n.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Next, Pallas azure-eyed in Mentor’s form<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with the voice of Mentor, summoning<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus abroad, him thus bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Telemachus! already at their oars<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sit all thy fellow-voyagers, and wait <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l520" id="BII_l520"></a>520</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy coming; linger not, but haste away.<br></span>
<span class="i1">This said, Minerva led him thence, whom he<br></span>
<span class="i0">With nimble steps follow’d, and on the shore<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arrived, found all his mariners prepared,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom thus the princely voyager address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Haste, my companions! bring we down the stores<br></span>
<span class="i0">Already sorted and set forth; but nought<br></span>
<span class="i0">My mother knows, or any of her train<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of this design, one matron sole except.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake, and led them; they, obedient, brought <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l530" id="BII_l530"></a>530</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">All down, and, as Ulysses’ son enjoin’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within the gallant bark the charge bestow’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then, led by Pallas, went the prince on board,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where down they sat, the Goddess in the stern,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And at her side Telemachus. The crew<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cast loose the hawsers, and embarking, fill’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The benches. Blue-eyed Pallas from the West<br></span>
<span class="i0">Call’d forth propitious breezes; fresh they curled<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sable Deep, and, sounding, swept the waves.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He loud-exhorting them, his people bade <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l540" id="BII_l540"></a>540</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Hand, brisk, the tackle; they, obedient, reared<br></span>
<span class="i0">The pine-tree mast, which in its socket deep<br></span>
<span class="i0">They lodg’d, then strain’d the cordage, and with thongs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Well-twisted, drew the shining sail aloft.<br></span>
<span class="i0">A land-breeze fill’d the canvas, and the flood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Roar’d as she went against the steady bark<br></span>
<span class="i0">That ran with even course her liquid way.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The rigging, thus, of all the galley set,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their beakers crowning high with wine, they hail’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The ever-living Gods, but above all <span class="linenum"><a name="BII_l550" id="BII_l550"></a>550</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Minerva, daughter azure-eyed of Jove.<br></span>

<span class="i0">Had brighten’d into day, cleaved swift the flood.<br></span>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">Telemachus arriving at Pylus, enquires of Nestor concerning Ulysses.
Nestor relates to him all that he knows or has heard of the Greecians
since their departure from the siege of Troy, but not being able to give
him any satisfactory account of Ulysses, refers him to Menelaus. At
evening Minerva quits Telemachus, but discovers herself in going. Nestor
sacrifices to the Goddess, and the solemnity ended, Telemachus sets forth
for Sparta in one of Nestor’s chariots, and accompanied by Nestor’s son,
Pisistratus.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sun, emerging from the lucid waves,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ascended now the brazen vault with light<br></span>
<span class="i0">For the inhabitants of earth and heav’n,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When in their bark at Pylus they arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">City of Neleus. On the shore they found<br></span>
<span class="i0">The people sacrificing; bulls they slew<br></span>
<span class="i0">Black without spot, to Neptune azure-hair’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">On ranges nine of seats they sat; each range<br></span>
<span class="i0">Received five hundred, and to each they made<br></span>
<span class="i0">Allotment equal of nine sable bulls. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l10" id="BIII_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The feast was now begun; these eating sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">The entrails, those stood off’ring to the God<br></span>
<span class="i0">The thighs, his portion, when the Ithacans<br></span>
<span class="i0">Push’d right ashore, and, furling close the sails,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And making fast their moorings, disembark’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forth came Telemachus, by Pallas led,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom thus the Goddess azure-eyed address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus! there is no longer room<br></span>
<span class="i0">For bashful fear, since thou hast cross’d the flood<br></span>
<span class="i0">With purpose to enquire what land conceals <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l20" id="BIII_l20"></a>20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy father, and what fate hath follow’d him.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Advance at once to the equestrian Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nestor, within whose bosom lies, perhaps,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Advice well worthy of thy search; entreat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself, that he will tell thee only truth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who will not lye, for he is passing wise.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Telemachus discrete replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ah Mentor! how can I advance, how greet<br></span>
<span class="i0">A Chief like him, unpractis’d as I am<br></span>
<span class="i0">In manag’d phrase? Shame bids the youth beware <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l30" id="BIII_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">How he accosts the man of many years.<br></span>
<span class="i1">But him the Goddess answer’d azure-eyed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus! Thou wilt, in part, thyself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fit speech devise, and heav’n will give the rest;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For thou wast neither born, nor hast been train’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To manhood, under unpropitious Pow’rs.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, Minerva led him thence, whom he<br></span>
<span class="i0">With nimble steps attending, soon arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">Among the multitude. There Nestor sat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Nestor’s sons, while, busily the feast <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l40" id="BIII_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Tending, his num’rous followers roasted, some,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The viands, some, transfix’d them with the spits.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They seeing guests arrived, together all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Advanced, and, grasping courteously their hands,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Invited them to sit; but first, the son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Nestor, young Pisistratus, approach’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, fast’ning on the hands of both, beside<br></span>
<span class="i0">The banquet placed them, where the beach was spread<br></span>
<span class="i0">With fleeces, and where Thrasymedes sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">His brother, and the hoary Chief his Sire. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l50" id="BIII_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To each a portion of the inner parts<br></span>
<span class="i0">He gave, then fill’d a golden cup with wine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which, tasted first, he to the daughter bore<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Jove the Thund’rer, and her thus bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Oh guest! the King of Ocean now adore!<br></span>
<span class="i0">For ye have chanced on Neptune’s festival;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, when thou hast, thyself, libation made<br></span>
<span class="i0">Duly, and pray’r, deliver to thy friend<br></span>
<span class="i0">The gen’rous juice, that he may also make<br></span>
<span class="i0">Libation; for he, doubtless, seeks, in prayer <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l60" id="BIII_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The Immortals, of whose favour all have need.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, since he younger is, and with myself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Coeval, first I give the cup to thee.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceas’d, and to her hand consign’d the cup,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which Pallas gladly from a youth received<br></span>
<span class="i0">So just and wise, who to herself had first<br></span>
<span class="i0">The golden cup presented, and in pray’r<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fervent the Sov’reign of the Seas adored.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Hear, earth-encircler Neptune! O vouchsafe<br></span>
<span class="i0">To us thy suppliants the desired effect <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l70" id="BIII_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of this our voyage; glory, first, bestow<br></span>
<span class="i0">On Nestor and his offspring both, then grant<br></span>
<span class="i0">To all the Pylians such a gracious boon<br></span>
<span class="i0">As shall requite their noble off’ring well.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grant also to Telemachus and me<br></span>
<span class="i0">To voyage hence, possess’d of what we sought<br></span>
<span class="i0">When hither in our sable bark we came.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So Pallas pray’d, and her own pray’r herself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Accomplish’d. To Telemachus she gave<br></span>
<span class="i0">The splendid goblet next, and in his turn <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l80" id="BIII_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Like pray’r Ulysses’ son also preferr’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now (the banquet from the spits withdrawn)<br></span>
<span class="i0">They next distributed sufficient share<br></span>
<span class="i0">To each, and all were sumptuously regaled.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At length, (both hunger satisfied and thirst)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Nestor, the Gerenian Chief, began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Now with more seemliness we may enquire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">After repast, what guests we have received.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our guests! who are ye? Whence have ye the waves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Plough’d hither? Come ye to transact concerns <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l90" id="BIII_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Commercial, or at random roam the Deep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Like pirates, who with mischief charged and woe<br></span>
<span class="i0">To foreign States, oft hazard life themselves?<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d, bolder now, but still discrete,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus. For Pallas had his heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">With manly courage arm’d, that he might ask<br></span>
<span class="i0">From Nestor tidings of his absent Sire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And win, himself, distinction and renown.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Oh Nestor, Neleus’ son, glory of Greece!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou askest whence we are. I tell thee whence. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l100" id="BIII_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">From Ithaca, by the umbrageous woods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Neritus o’erhung, by private need,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not public, urged, we come. My errand is<br></span>
<span class="i0">To seek intelligence of the renown’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses; of my noble father, prais’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">For dauntless courage, whom report proclaims<br></span>
<span class="i0">Conqueror, with thine aid, of sacred Troy.<br></span>
<span class="i0">We have already learn’d where other Chiefs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who fought at Ilium, died; but Jove conceals<br></span>
<span class="i0">Even the death of my illustrious Sire <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l110" id="BIII_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In dull obscurity; for none hath heard<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or confident can answer, where he dy’d;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whether he on the continent hath fall’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">By hostile hands, or by the waves o’erwhelm’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Amphitrite, welters in the Deep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For this cause, at thy knees suppliant, I beg<br></span>
<span class="i0">That thou would’st tell me his disast’rous end,<br></span>
<span class="i0">If either thou beheld’st that dread event<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thyself, or from some wanderer of the Greeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hast heard it: for my father at his birth <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l120" id="BIII_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Was, sure, predestin’d to no common woes.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Neither through pity, or o’erstrain’d respect<br></span>
<span class="i0">Flatter me, but explicit all relate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which thou hast witness’d. If my noble Sire<br></span>
<span class="i0">E’er gratified thee by performance just<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of word or deed at Ilium, where ye fell<br></span>
<span class="i0">So num’rous slain in fight, oh, recollect<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now his fidelity, and tell me true.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then Nestor thus Gerenian Hero old.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Young friend! since thou remind’st me, speaking thus, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l130" id="BIII_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the woes which indefatigable<br></span>
<span class="i0">We sons of the Achaians there sustain’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both those which wand’ring on the Deep we bore<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wherever by Achilles led in quest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of booty, and the many woes beside<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which under royal Priam’s spacious walls<br></span>
<span class="i0">We suffer’d, know, that there our bravest fell.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There warlike Ajax lies, there Peleus’ son;<br></span>
<span class="i0">There, too, Patroclus, like the Gods themselves<br></span>
<span class="i0">In council, and my son beloved there, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l140" id="BIII_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Brave, virtuous, swift of foot, and bold in fight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Antilochus. Nor are these sorrows all;<br></span>
<span class="i0">What tongue of mortal man could all relate?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should’st thou, abiding here, five years employ<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or six, enquiring of the woes endured<br></span>
<span class="i0">By the Achaians, ere thou should’st have learn’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The whole, thou would’st depart, tir’d of the tale.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For we, nine years, stratagems of all kinds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Devised against them, and Saturnian Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce crown’d the difficult attempt at last. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l150" id="BIII_l150"></a>150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">There, no competitor in wiles well-plann’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses found, so far were all surpass’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">In shrewd invention by thy noble Sire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">If thou indeed art his, as sure thou art,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose sight breeds wonder in me, and thy speech<br></span>
<span class="i0">His speech resembles more than might be deem’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within the scope of years so green as thine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There, never in opinion, or in voice<br></span>
<span class="i0">Illustrious Ulysses and myself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Divided were, but, one in heart, contrived <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l160" id="BIII_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">As best we might, the benefit of all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But after Priam’s lofty city sack’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the departure of the Greeks on board<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their barks, and when the Gods had scatter’d them,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then Jove imagin’d for the Argive host<br></span>
<span class="i0">A sorrowful return; for neither just<br></span>
<span class="i0">Were all, nor prudent, therefore many found<br></span>
<span class="i0">A fate disast’rous through the vengeful ire<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Jove-born Pallas, who between the sons<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Atreus sharp contention interposed. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l170" id="BIII_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">They both, irregularly, and against<br></span>
<span class="i0">Just order, summoning by night the Greeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">To council, of whom many came with wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oppress’d, promulgated the cause for which<br></span>
<span class="i0">They had convened the people. Then it was<br></span>
<span class="i0">That Menelaus bade the general host<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their thoughts bend homeward o’er the sacred Deep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which Agamemnon in no sort approved.<br></span>
<span class="i0">His counsel was to slay them yet at Troy,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That so he might assuage the dreadful wrath <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l180" id="BIII_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Pallas, first, by sacrifice and pray’r.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Vain hope! he little thought how ill should speed<br></span>
<span class="i0">That fond attempt, for, once provok’d, the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Are not with ease conciliated again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus stood the brothers, altercation hot<br></span>
<span class="i0">Maintaining, till at length, uprose the Greeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">With deaf’ning clamours, and with diff’ring minds.<br></span>
<span class="i0">We slept the night, but teeming with disgust<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mutual, for Jove great woe prepar’d for all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At dawn of day we drew our gallies down <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l190" id="BIII_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Into the sea, and, hasty, put on board<br></span>
<span class="i0">The spoils and female captives. Half the host,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With Agamemnon, son of Atreus, stay’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Supreme commander, and, embarking, half<br></span>
<span class="i0">Push’d forth. Swift course we made, for Neptune smooth’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The waves before us of the monstrous Deep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At Tenedos arriv’d, we there perform’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sacrifice to the Gods, ardent to reach<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our native land, but unpropitious Jove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not yet designing our arrival there, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l200" id="BIII_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Involved us in dissension fierce again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For all the crews, followers of the King,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy noble Sire, to gratify our Chief,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The son of Atreus, chose a diff’rent course,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And steer’d their oary barks again to Troy.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But I, assured that evil from the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Impended, gath’ring all my gallant fleet,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fled thence in haste, and warlike Diomede<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exhorting his attendants, also fled.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At length, the Hero Menelaus join’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l210" id="BIII_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Our fleets at Lesbos; there he found us held<br></span>
<span class="i0">In deep deliberation on the length<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of way before us, whether we should steer<br></span>
<span class="i0">Above the craggy Chios to the isle<br></span>
<span class="i0">Psyria, that island holding on our left,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or under Chios by the wind-swept heights<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Mimas. Then we ask’d from Jove a sign,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And by a sign vouchsafed he bade us cut<br></span>
<span class="i0">The wide sea to Eubœa sheer athwart,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So soonest to escape the threat’ned harm. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l220" id="BIII_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Shrill sang the rising gale, and with swift prows<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cleaving the fishy flood, we reach’d by night<br></span>
<span class="i0">Geræstus, where arrived, we burn’d the thighs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of num’rous bulls to Neptune, who had safe<br></span>
<span class="i0">Conducted us through all our perilous course.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The fleet of Diomede in safety moor’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">On the fourth day at Argos, but myself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Held on my course to Pylus, nor the wind<br></span>
<span class="i0">One moment thwarted us, or died away,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When Jove had once commanded it to blow. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l230" id="BIII_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus, uninform’d, I have arrived, my son!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor of the Greecians, who are saved have heard,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or who have perish’d; but what news soe’er<br></span>
<span class="i0">I have obtain’d, since my return, with truth<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will relate, nor aught conceal from thee.<br></span>
<span class="i1">The spear-famed Myrmidons, as rumour speaks,<br></span>
<span class="i0">By Neoptolemus, illustrious son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of brave Achilles led, have safe arrived;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Safe, Philoctetes, also son renown’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Pæas; and Idomeneus at Crete <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l240" id="BIII_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath landed all his followers who survive<br></span>
<span class="i0">The bloody war, the waves have swallow’d none.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ye have yourselves doubtless, although remote,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Agamemnon heard, how he return’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And how Ægisthus cruelly contrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">For him a bloody welcome, but himself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath with his own life paid the murth’rous deed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Good is it, therefore, if a son survive<br></span>
<span class="i0">The slain, since Agamemnon’s son hath well<br></span>
<span class="i0">Avenged his father’s death, slaying, himself, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l250" id="BIII_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ægisthus, foul assassin of his Sire.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Young friend! (for pleas’d thy vig’rous youth I view,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And just proportion) be thou also bold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That thine like his may be a deathless name.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then, prudent, him answer’d Telemachus.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh Nestor, Neleus’ son, glory of Greece!<br></span>
<span class="i0">And righteous was that vengeance; <i>his</i> renown<br></span>
<span class="i0">Achaia’s sons shall far and wide diffuse,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To future times transmitting it in song.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! would that such ability the Gods <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l260" id="BIII_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Would grant to me, that I, as well, the deeds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Might punish of our suitors, whose excess<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enormous, and whose bitter taunts I feel<br></span>
<span class="i0">Continual, object of their subtle hate.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But not for me such happiness the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have twined into my thread; no, not for me<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or for my father. Patience is our part.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Young friend! (since thou remind’st me of that theme)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fame here reports that num’rous suitors haunt <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l270" id="BIII_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy palace for thy mother’s sake, and there<br></span>
<span class="i0">Much evil perpetrate in thy despight.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But say, endur’st thou willing their controul<br></span>
<span class="i0">Imperious, or because the people, sway’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">By some response oracular, incline<br></span>
<span class="i0">Against thee? But who knows? the time may come<br></span>
<span class="i0">When to his home restored, either alone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or aided by the force of all the Greeks,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses may avenge the wrong; at least,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should Pallas azure-eyed thee love, as erst <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l280" id="BIII_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">At Troy, the scene of our unnumber’d woes,<br></span>
<span class="i0">She lov’d Ulysses (for I have not known<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Gods assisting so apparently<br></span>
<span class="i0">A mortal man, as him Minerva there)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should Pallas view thee also with like love<br></span>
<span class="i0">And kind solicitude, some few of those<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should dream, perchance, of wedlock never more.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer thus Telemachus return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">That word’s accomplishment I cannot hope;<br></span>
<span class="i0">It promises too much; the thought alone <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l290" id="BIII_l290"></a>290</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">O’erwhelms me; an event so fortunate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Would, unexpected on my part, arrive,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Although the Gods themselves should purpose it.<br></span>
<span class="i1">But Pallas him answer’d cærulean-eyed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus! what word was that which leap’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The iv’ry guard<a name="fnm_7" id="fnm_7"></a><a href="#fn_7" class="fnnum">7</a> that should have fenced it in?<br></span>
<span class="i0">A God, so willing, could with utmost ease<br></span>
<span class="i0">Save any man, howe’er remote. Myself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I had much rather, many woes endured,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Revisit home, at last, happy and safe, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l300" id="BIII_l300"></a>300</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Than, sooner coming, die in my own house,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As Agamemnon perish’d by the arts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of base Ægisthus and the subtle Queen.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet not the Gods themselves can save from death<br></span>
<span class="i0">All-levelling, the man whom most they love,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When Fate ordains him once to his last sleep.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Howe’er it interest us, let us leave<br></span>
<span class="i0">This question, Mentor! He, I am assured,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Returns no more, but hath already found <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l310" id="BIII_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A sad, sad fate by the decree of heav’n.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But I would now interrogate again<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nestor, and on a different theme, for him<br></span>
<span class="i0">In human rights I judge, and laws expert,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in all knowledge beyond other men;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For he hath govern’d, as report proclaims,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Three generations; therefore in my eyes<br></span>
<span class="i0">He wears the awful impress of a God.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh Nestor, son of Neleus, tell me true;<br></span>
<span class="i0">What was the manner of Atrides’ death, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l320" id="BIII_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Wide-ruling Agamemnon? Tell me where<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was Menelaus? By what means contrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ægisthus to inflict the fatal blow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slaying so much a nobler than himself?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had not the brother of the Monarch reach’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Achaian Argos yet, but, wand’ring still<br></span>
<span class="i0">In other climes, his long absence gave<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ægisthus courage for that bloody deed?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom answer’d the Gerenian Chief renown’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My son! I will inform thee true; meantime <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l330" id="BIII_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy own suspicions border on the fact.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had Menelaus, Hero, amber hair’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ægisthus found living at his return<br></span>
<span class="i0">From Ilium, never on <i>his</i> bones the Greeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had heap’d a tomb, but dogs and rav’ning fowls<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had torn him lying in the open field<br></span>
<span class="i0">Far from the town, nor him had woman wept<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all in Greece, for he had foul transgress’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But we, in many an arduous task engaged,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lay before Ilium; he, the while, secure <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l340" id="BIII_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Within the green retreats of Argos, found<br></span>
<span class="i0">Occasion apt by flatt’ry to delude<br></span>
<span class="i0">The spouse of Agamemnon; she, at first,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(The royal Clytemnestra) firm refused<br></span>
<span class="i0">The deed dishonourable (for she bore<br></span>
<span class="i0">A virtuous mind, and at her side a bard<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attended ever, whom the King, to Troy<br></span>
<span class="i0">Departing, had appointed to the charge.)<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when the Gods had purposed to ensnare<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ægisthus, then dismissing far remote <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l350" id="BIII_l350"></a>350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The bard into a desart isle, he there<br></span>
<span class="i0">Abandon’d him to rav’ning fowls a prey,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to his own home, willing as himself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Led Clytemnestra. Num’rous thighs he burn’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">On all their hallow’d altars to the Gods,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And hung with tap’stry, images, and gold<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their shrines, his great exploit past hope atchiev’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">We (Menelaus and myself) had sailed<br></span>
<span class="i0">From Troy together, but when we approach’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sunium, headland of th’ Athenian shore, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l360" id="BIII_l360"></a>360</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">There Phœbus, sudden, with his gentle shafts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slew Menelaus’ pilot while he steer’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The volant bark, Phrontis, Onetor’s son,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A mariner past all expert, whom none<br></span>
<span class="i0">In steerage match’d, what time the tempest roar’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here, therefore, Menelaus was detained,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Giving his friend due burial, and his rites<br></span>
<span class="i0">Funereal celebrating, though in haste<br></span>
<span class="i0">Still to proceed. But when, with all his fleet<br></span>
<span class="i0">The wide sea traversing, he reach’d at length <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l370" id="BIII_l370"></a>370</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Malea’s lofty foreland in his course,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rough passage, then, and perilous he found.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shrill blasts the Thund’rer pour’d into his sails,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And wild waves sent him mountainous. His ships<br></span>
<span class="i0">There scatter’d, some to the Cydonian coast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Crete he push’d, near where the Jardan flows.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the confines of Gortyna stands,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the gloomy flood, a smooth rock, steep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Toward the sea, against whose leftward point<br></span>
<span class="i0">Phæstus by name, the South wind rolls the surge <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l380" id="BIII_l380"></a>380</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Amain, which yet the rock, though small, repells.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hither with part he came, and scarce the crews<br></span>
<span class="i0">Themselves escaped, while the huge billows broke<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their ships against the rocks; yet five he saved,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which winds and waves drove to the Ægyptian shore.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus he, provision gath’ring as he went<br></span>
<span class="i0">And gold abundant, roam’d to distant lands<br></span>
<span class="i0">And nations of another tongue. Meantime,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ægisthus these enormities at home<br></span>
<span class="i0">Devising, slew Atrides, and supreme <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l390" id="BIII_l390"></a>390</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Rul’d the subjected land; sev’n years he reign’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">In opulent Mycenæ, but the eighth<br></span>
<span class="i0">From Athens brought renown’d Orestes home<br></span>
<span class="i0">For his destruction, who of life bereaved<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ægisthus base assassin of his Sire.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Orestes, therefore, the funereal rites<br></span>
<span class="i0">Performing to his shameless mother’s shade<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to her lustful paramour, a feast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gave to the Argives; on which self-same day<br></span>
<span class="i0">The warlike Menelaus, with his ships <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l400" id="BIII_l400"></a>400</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">All treasure-laden to the brink, arrived.<br></span>
<span class="i1">And thou, young friend! from thy forsaken home<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rove not long time remote, thy treasures left<br></span>
<span class="i0">At mercy of those proud, lest they divide<br></span>
<span class="i0">And waste the whole, rend’ring thy voyage vain.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But hence to Menelaus is the course<br></span>
<span class="i0">To which I counsel thee; for he hath come<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of late from distant lands, whence to escape<br></span>
<span class="i0">No man could hope, whom tempests first had driv’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">Devious into so wide a sea, from which <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l410" id="BIII_l410"></a>410</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Themselves the birds of heaven could not arrive<br></span>
<span class="i0">In a whole year, so vast is the expanse.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Go, then, with ship and shipmates, or if more<br></span>
<span class="i0">The land delight thee, steeds thou shalt not want<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor chariot, and my sons shall be thy guides<br></span>
<span class="i0">To noble Lacedemon, the abode<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Menelaus; ask from him the truth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who will not lye, for he is passing wise.<br></span>
<span class="i1">While thus he spake, the sun declined, and night<br></span>
<span class="i0">Approaching, blue-eyed Pallas interposed. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l420" id="BIII_l420"></a>420</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">O antient King! well hast thou spoken all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But now delay not. Cut ye forth the tongues,<a name="fnm_8" id="fnm_8"></a><a href="#fn_8" class="fnnum">8</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">And mingle wine, that (Neptune first invoked<br></span>
<span class="i0">With due libation, and the other Gods)<br></span>
<span class="i0">We may repair to rest; for even now<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sun is sunk, and it becomes us not<br></span>
<span class="i0">Long to protract a banquet to the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Devote, but in fit season to depart.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake Jove’s daughter; they obedient heard.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The heralds, then, pour’d water on their hands, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l430" id="BIII_l430"></a>430</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And the attendant youths, filling the cups,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Served them from left to right. Next all the tongues<br></span>
<span class="i0">They cast into the fire, and ev’ry guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arising, pour’d libation to the Gods.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Libation made, and all with wine sufficed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Godlike Telemachus and Pallas both<br></span>
<span class="i0">Would have return’d, incontinent, on board,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But Nestor urged them still to be his guests.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Forbid it, Jove, and all the Pow’rs of heav’n!<br></span>
<span class="i0">That ye should leave me to repair on board <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l440" id="BIII_l440"></a>440</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Your vessel, as I were some needy wretch<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cloakless and destitute of fleecy stores<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wherewith to spread the couch soft for myself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or for my guests. No. I have garments warm<br></span>
<span class="i0">An ample store, and rugs of richest dye;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And never shall Ulysses’ son belov’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0"><a name="BIII_l447" id="BIII_l447"></a>My frend’s own son, sleep on a galley’s plank<br></span>
<span class="i0">While I draw vital air; grant also, heav’n,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That, dying, I may leave behind me sons<br></span>
<span class="i0">Glad to accommodate whatever guest! <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l450" id="BIII_l450"></a>450</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d then Pallas cærulean-eyed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Old Chief! thou hast well said, and reason bids<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus thy kind commands obey.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Let <i>him</i> attend thee hence, that he may sleep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath thy roof, but I return on board<br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself, to instruct my people, and to give<br></span>
<span class="i0">All needful orders; for among them none<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is old as I, but they are youths alike,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Coevals of Telemachus, with whom<br></span>
<span class="i0">They have embark’d for friendship’s sake alone. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l460" id="BIII_l460"></a>460</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I therefore will repose myself on board<br></span>
<span class="i0">This night, and to the Caucons bold in arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will sail to-morrow, to demand arrears<br></span>
<span class="i0">Long time unpaid, and of no small amount.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, since he is become thy guest, afford<br></span>
<span class="i0">My friend a chariot, and a son of thine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who shall direct his way, nor let him want<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all thy steeds the swiftest and the best.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, the blue-eyed Goddess as upborne<br></span>
<span class="i0">On eagle’s wings, vanish’d; amazement seized <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l470" id="BIII_l470"></a>470</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The whole assembly, and the antient King<br></span>
<span class="i0">O’erwhelmed with wonder at that sight, the hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grasp’d of Telemachus, whom he thus bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My friend! I prophesy that thou shalt prove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor base nor dastard, whom, so young, the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Already take in charge; for of the Pow’rs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Inhabitants of heav’n, none else was this<br></span>
<span class="i0">Than Jove’s own daughter Pallas, who among<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Greecians honour’d most thy gen’rous Sire.<br></span>
<span class="i1">But thou, O Queen! compassionate us all, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l480" id="BIII_l480"></a>480</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself, my sons, my comfort; give to each<br></span>
<span class="i0">A glorious name, and I to thee will give<br></span>
<span class="i0">For sacrifice an heifer of the year,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Broad-fronted, one that never yet hath borne<br></span>
<span class="i0">The yoke, and will incase her horns with gold.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So Nestor pray’d, whom Pallas gracious heard.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then the Gerenian warrior old, before<br></span>
<span class="i0">His sons and sons in law, to his abode<br></span>
<span class="i0">Magnificent proceeded: they (arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within the splendid palace of the King) <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l490" id="BIII_l490"></a>490</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">On thrones and couches sat in order ranged,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Nestor welcom’d, charging high the cup<br></span>
<span class="i0">With wine of richest sort, which she who kept<br></span>
<span class="i0">That treasure, now in the eleventh year<br></span>
<span class="i0">First broach’d, unsealing the delicious juice.<br></span>
<span class="i0">With this the hoary Senior fill’d a cup,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to the daughter of Jove Ægis-arm’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pouring libation, offer’d fervent pray’r.<br></span>
<span class="i1">When all had made libation, and no wish<br></span>
<span class="i0">Remain’d of more, then each to rest retired, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l500" id="BIII_l500"></a>500</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And Nestor the Gerenian warrior old<br></span>
<span class="i0">Led thence Telemachus to a carved couch<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the sounding portico prepared.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside him he bade sleep the spearman bold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pisistratus, a gallant youth, the sole<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unwedded in his house of all his sons.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself in the interior palace lay,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where couch and cov’ring for her antient spouse<br></span>
<span class="i0">The consort Queen had diligent prepar’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l510" id="BIII_l510"></a>510</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Had tinged the East, arising from his bed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gerenian Nestor issued forth, and sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before his palace-gate on the white stones<br></span>
<span class="i0">Resplendent as with oil, on which of old<br></span>
<span class="i0">His father Neleus had been wont to sit,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In council like a God; but he had sought,<br></span>
<span class="i0">By destiny dismiss’d long since, the shades.<br></span>
<span class="i0">On those stones therefore now, Nestor himself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Achaia’s guardian, sat, sceptre in hand,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where soon his num’rous sons, leaving betimes <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l520" id="BIII_l520"></a>520</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The place of their repose, also appeared,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Echephron, Stratius, Perseus, Thrasymedes,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Aretus and Pisistratus. They placed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Godlike Telemachus at Nestor’s side,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the Gerenian Hero thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Sons be ye quick—execute with dispatch<br></span>
<span class="i0">My purpose, that I may propitiate first<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the Gods Minerva, who herself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath honour’d manifest our hallow’d feast.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Haste, one, into the field, to order thence <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l530" id="BIII_l530"></a>530</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">An ox, and let the herdsman drive it home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Another, hasting to the sable bark<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of brave Telemachus, bring hither all<br></span>
<span class="i0">His friends, save two, and let a third command<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laerceus, that he come to enwrap with gold<br></span>
<span class="i0">The victim’s horns. Abide ye here, the rest,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And bid my female train (for I intend<br></span>
<span class="i0">A banquet) with all diligence provide<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seats, stores of wood, and water from the rock.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, whom instant all obey’d. The ox <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l540" id="BIII_l540"></a>540</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Came from the field, and from the gallant ship<br></span>
<span class="i0">The ship-mates of the brave Telemachus;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Next, charged with all his implements of art,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His mallet, anvil, pincers, came the smith<br></span>
<span class="i0">To give the horns their gilding; also came<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pallas herself to her own sacred rites.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then Nestor, hoary warrior, furnish’d gold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which, hammer’d thin, the artist wrapp’d around<br></span>
<span class="i0">The victim’s horns, that seeing him attired<br></span>
<span class="i0">So costly, Pallas might the more be pleased. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l550" id="BIII_l550"></a>550</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Stratius and brave Echephron introduced<br></span>
<span class="i0">The victim by his horns; Aretus brought<br></span>
<span class="i0">A laver in one hand, with flow’rs emboss’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in his other hand a basket stored<br></span>
<span class="i0">With cakes, while warlike Thrasymedes, arm’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With his long-hafted ax, prepared to smite<br></span>
<span class="i0">The ox, and Perseus to receive the blood.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The hoary Nestor consecrated first<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both cakes and water, and with earnest pray’r<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Pallas, gave the forelock to the flames. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l560" id="BIII_l560"></a>560</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">When all had worshipp’d, and the broken cakes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sprinkled, then godlike Thrasymedes drew<br></span>
<span class="i0">Close to the ox, and smote him. Deep the edge<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enter’d, and senseless on the floor he fell.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then Nestor’s daughters, and the consorts all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Nestor’s sons, with his own consort, chaste<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eurydice, the daughter eldest-born<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Clymenus, in one shrill orison<br></span>
<span class="i0">Vocif’rous join’d, while they, lifting the ox,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Held him supported firmly, and the prince <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l570" id="BIII_l570"></a>570</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of men, Pisistratus, his gullet pierced.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Soon as the sable blood had ceased, and life<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had left the victim, spreading him abroad,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With nice address they parted at the joint<br></span>
<span class="i0">His thighs, and wrapp’d them in the double cawl,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which with crude slices thin they overspread.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nestor burn’d incense, and libation pour’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Large on the hissing brands, while him beside,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Busy with spit and prong, stood many a youth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Train’d to the task. The thighs consumed, each took<br></span>
<span class="i0">His portion of the maw, then, slashing well <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l581" id="BIII_l581"></a>581</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The remnant, they transpierced it with the spits<br></span>
<span class="i0">Neatly, and held it reeking at the fire.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the youngest of the daughters fair<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Nestor, beauteous Polycaste, laved,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Anointed, and in vest and tunic cloathed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus, who, so refresh’d, stepp’d forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">From the bright laver graceful as a God,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And took his seat at antient Nestor’s side.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The viands dress’d, and from the spits withdrawn, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l590" id="BIII_l590"></a>590</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">They sat to share the feast, and princely youths<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arising, gave them wine in cups of gold.<br></span>
<span class="i0">When neither hunger now nor thirst remain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unsated, thus Gerenian Nestor spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My sons, arise, lead forth the sprightly steeds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And yoke them, that Telemachus may go.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake the Chief, to whose commands his sons,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Obedient, yoked in haste the rapid steeds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the intendant matron of the stores<br></span>
<span class="i0">Disposed meantime within the chariot, bread <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l600" id="BIII_l600"></a>600</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And wine, and dainties, such as princes eat.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus into the chariot first<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ascended, and beside him, next, his place<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pisistratus the son of Nestor took,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then seiz’d the reins, and lash’d the coursers on.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They, nothing loth, into the open plain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Flew, leaving lofty Pylus soon afar.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, journeying, they shook on either side<br></span>
<span class="i0">The yoke all day, and now the setting sun<br></span>
<span class="i0">To dusky evening had resign’d the roads, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l610" id="BIII_l610"></a>610</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">When they to Pheræ came, and the abode<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reach’d of Diocles, whose illustrious Sire<br></span>
<span class="i0">Orsilochus from Alpheus drew his birth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And there, with kindness entertain’d, they slept.<br></span>
<span class="i1">But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Look’d rosy from the East, yoking the steeds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They in their sumptuous chariot sat again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The son of Nestor plied the lash, and forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Through vestibule and sounding portico<br></span>
<span class="i0">The royal coursers, not unwilling, flew. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIII_l620" id="BIII_l620"></a>620</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A corn-invested land receiv’d them next,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And there they brought their journey to a close,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So rapidly they moved; and now the sun<br></span>
<span class="i0">Went down, and even-tide dimm’d all the ways.<br></span>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">Telemachus, with Pisistratus, arrives at the palace of Menelaus, from
whom he receives some fresh information concerning the return of the
Greecians, and is in particular told on the authority of Proteus, that
his father is detained by Calypso. The suitors, plotting against the life
of Telemachus, lie in wait to intercept him in his return to Ithaca.
Penelope being informed of his departure, and of their designs to slay
him, becomes inconsolable, but is relieved by a dream sent to her from
Minerva.</p>

<span class="i0">His daughter to renown’d Achilles’ heir<br></span>
<span class="i0">He sent, to whom he had at Troy engaged<br></span>
<span class="i0">To give her, and the Gods now made her his.<br></span>
<span class="i0">With chariots and with steeds he sent her forth <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l10" id="BIV_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To the illustrious city where the prince,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Achilles’ offspring, ruled the Myrmidons.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But to his son he gave a Spartan fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alector’s daughter; from an handmaid sprang<br></span>
<span class="i0">That son to Menelaus in his age,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Brave Megapenthes; for the Gods no child<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Helen gave, made mother, once, of her<br></span>

<span class="i1">Thus all the neighbour princes and the friends <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l20" id="BIV_l20"></a>20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of noble Menelaus, feasting sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within his spacious palace, among whom<br></span>
<span class="i0">A sacred bard sang sweetly to his harp,<br></span>
<span class="i0">While, in the midst, two dancers smote the ground<br></span>
<span class="i0">With measur’d steps responsive to his song.<br></span>
<span class="i1">And now the Heroes, Nestor’s noble son<br></span>
<span class="i0">And young Telemachus arrived within<br></span>
<span class="i0">The vestibule, whom, issuing from the hall,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The noble Eteoneus of the train<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Menelaus, saw; at once he ran <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l30" id="BIV_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Across the palace to report the news<br></span>
<span class="i0">To his Lord’s ear, and, standing at his side,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In accents wing’d with haste thus greeted him.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Oh Menelaus! Heav’n descended Chief!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Two guests arrive, both strangers, but the race<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Jove supreme resembling each in form.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Say, shall we loose, ourselves, their rapid steeds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or hence dismiss them to some other host?<br></span>
<span class="i1">But Menelaus, Hero golden-hair’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Indignant answer’d him. Boethe’s son! <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l40" id="BIV_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wast not, Eteoneus, heretofore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A babbler, who now pratest as a child.<br></span>
<span class="i0">We have ourselves arrived indebted much<br></span>
<span class="i0">To hospitality of other men,<br></span>
<span class="i0">If Jove shall, even here, some pause at last<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of woe afford us. Therefore loose, at once,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their steeds, and introduce them to the feast.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and, issuing, Eteoneus call’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The brisk attendants to his aid, with whom<br></span>
<span class="i0">He loos’d their foaming coursers from the yoke. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l50" id="BIV_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Them first they bound to mangers, which with oats<br></span>
<span class="i0">And mingled barley they supplied, then thrust<br></span>
<span class="i0">The chariot sidelong to the splendid wall.<a name="fnm_9" id="fnm_9"></a><a href="#fn_9" class="fnnum">9</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">Themselves he, next, into the royal house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Conducted, who survey’d, wond’ring, the abode<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the heav’n-favour’d King; for on all sides<br></span>
<span class="i0">As with the splendour of the sun or moon<br></span>
<span class="i0">The lofty dome of Menelaus blazed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Satiate, at length, with wonder at that sight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They enter’d each a bath, and by the hands <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l60" id="BIV_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of maidens laved, and oil’d, and cloath’d again<br></span>
<span class="i0">With shaggy mantles and resplendent vests,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sat both enthroned at Menelaus’ side.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now a maiden charged with golden ew’r,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with an argent laver, pouring first<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pure water on their hands, supplied them next<br></span>
<span class="i0">With a bright table, which the maiden, chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">In office, furnish’d plenteously with bread<br></span>
<span class="i0">And dainties, remnants of the last regale.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then came the sew’r, who with delicious meats <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l70" id="BIV_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Dish after dish, served them, and placed beside<br></span>
<span class="i0">The chargers cups magnificent of gold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When Menelaus grasp’d their hands, and said.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Eat and rejoice, and when ye shall have shared<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our nuptial banquet, we will then inquire<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who are ye both, for, certain, not from those<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose generation perishes are ye,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But rather of some race of sceptred Chiefs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heav’n-born; the base have never sons like you.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he from the board lifted his own <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l80" id="BIV_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Distinguish’d portion, and the fatted chine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gave to his guests; the sav’ry viands they<br></span>
<span class="i0">With outstretch’d hands assail’d, and when the force<br></span>
<span class="i0">No longer now of appetite they felt,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus, inclining close his head<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Nestor’s son, lest others should his speech<br></span>
<span class="i0">Witness, in whisper’d words him thus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Dearest Pisistratus, observe, my friend!<br></span>
<span class="i0">How all the echoing palace with the light<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of beaming brass, of gold and amber shines <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l90" id="BIV_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Silver and ivory! for radiance such<br></span>
<span class="i0">Th’ interior mansion of Olympian Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">I deem. What wealth, how various, how immense<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is here! astonish’d I survey the sight!<br></span>
<span class="i1">But Menelaus, golden-hair’d, his speech<br></span>
<span class="i0">O’erhearing, thus in accents wing’d replied<br></span>
<span class="i1">My children! let no mortal man pretend<br></span>
<span class="i0">Comparison with Jove; for Jove’s abode<br></span>
<span class="i0">And all his stores are incorruptible.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But whether mortal man with me may vie <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l100" id="BIV_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In the display of wealth, or whether not,<br></span>
<span class="i0">This know, that after many toils endured,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And perilous wand’rings wide, in the eighth year<br></span>
<span class="i0">I brought my treasures home. Remote I roved<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Cyprus, to Phœnice, to the shores<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ægypt; Æthiopia’s land I reach’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Th’ Erembi, the Sidonians, and the coasts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Lybia, where the lambs their foreheads shew<br></span>
<span class="i0">At once with horns defended, soon as yean’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There, thrice within the year the flocks produce, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l110" id="BIV_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor master, there, nor shepherd ever feels<br></span>
<span class="i0">A dearth of cheese, of flesh, or of sweet milk<br></span>
<span class="i0">Delicious, drawn from udders never dry.<br></span>
<span class="i0">While, thus, commodities on various coasts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gath’ring I roam’d, another, by the arts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of his pernicious spouse aided, of life<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bereav’d my brother privily, and when least<br></span>
<span class="i0">He fear’d to lose it. Therefore little joy<br></span>
<span class="i0">To me results from all that I possess.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Your fathers (be those fathers who they may) <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l120" id="BIV_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">These things have doubtless told you; for immense<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have been my suff’rings, and I have destroy’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">A palace well inhabited and stored<br></span>
<span class="i0">With precious furniture in ev’ry kind;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such, that I would to heav’n! I own’d at home<br></span>
<span class="i0">Though but the third of it, and that the Greeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who perish’d then, beneath the walls of Troy<br></span>
<span class="i0">Far from steed-pastured Argos, still survived.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet while, sequester’d here, I frequent mourn<br></span>
<span class="i0">My slaughter’d friends, by turns I sooth my soul <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l130" id="BIV_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With tears shed for them, and by turns again<br></span>
<span class="i0">I cease; for grief soon satiates free indulged.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But of them all, although I all bewail,<br></span>
<span class="i0">None mourn I so as one, whom calling back<br></span>
<span class="i0">To memory, I both sleep and food abhor.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For, of Achaia’s sons none ever toiled<br></span>
<span class="i0">Strenuous as Ulysses; but his lot<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was woe, and unremitting sorrow mine<br></span>
<span class="i0">For his long absence, who, if still he live,<br></span>
<span class="i0">We know not aught, or be already dead. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l140" id="BIV_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Him doubtless, old Laertes mourns, and him<br></span>
<span class="i0">Discrete Penelope, nor less his son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus, born newly when he sail’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he kindled in him strong desire<br></span>
<span class="i0">To mourn his father; at his father’s name<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fast fell his tears to ground, and with both hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">He spread his purple cloak before his eyes;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which Menelaus marking, doubtful sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">If he should leave him leisure for his tears,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or question him, and tell him all at large. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l150" id="BIV_l150"></a>150</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">While thus he doubted, Helen (as it chanced)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving her fragrant chamber, came, august<br></span>
<span class="i0">As Dian, goddess of the golden bow.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Adrasta, for her use, set forth a throne,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alcippe with soft arras cover’d it,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Philo brought her silver basket, gift<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of fair Alcandra, wife of Polybus,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose mansion in Ægyptian Thebes is rich<br></span>
<span class="i0">In untold treasure, and who gave, himself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ten golden talents, and two silver baths <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l160" id="BIV_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To Menelaus, with two splendid tripods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the noble gifts which, at the hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of his illustrious spouse, Helen receiv’d;<br></span>
<span class="i0">A golden spindle, and a basket wheel’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Itself of silver, and its lip of gold.<br></span>
<span class="i0">That basket Philo, her own handmaid, placed<br></span>
<span class="i0">At beauteous Helen’s side, charged to the brim<br></span>
<span class="i0">With slender threads, on which the spindle lay<br></span>
<span class="i0">With wool of purple lustre wrapp’d around.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Approaching, on her foot-stool’d throne she sat, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l170" id="BIV_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And, instant, of her royal spouse enquired.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Know we, my Menelaus, dear to Jove!<br></span>
<span class="i0">These guests of ours, and whence they have arrived?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Erroneous I may speak, yet speak I must;<br></span>
<span class="i0">In man or woman never have I seen<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such likeness to another (wonder-fixt<br></span>
<span class="i0">I gaze) as in this stranger to the son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of brave Ulysses, whom that Hero left<br></span>
<span class="i0">New-born at home, when (shameless as I was)<br></span>
<span class="i0">For my unworthy sake the Greecians sailed <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l180" id="BIV_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To Ilium, with fierce rage of battle fir’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then Menelaus, thus, the golden-hair’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I also such resemblance find in him<br></span>
<span class="i0">As thou; such feet, such hands, the cast of eye<a name="fnm_10" id="fnm_10"></a><a href="#fn_10" class="fnnum">10</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">Similar, and the head and flowing locks.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And even now, when I Ulysses named,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And his great sufferings mention’d, in my cause,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The bitter tear dropp’d from his lids, while broad<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before his eyes his purple cloak he spread.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom the son of Nestor thus replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l190" id="BIV_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Atrides! Menelaus! Chief renown’d!<br></span>
<span class="i0">He is in truth his son, as thou hast said,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But he is modest, and would much himself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Condemn, if, at his first arrival here,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He should loquacious seem and bold to thee,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To whom we listen, captived by thy voice,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As if some God had spoken. As for me,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nestor, my father, the Gerenian Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bade me conduct him hither, for he wish’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To see thee, promising himself from thee <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l200" id="BIV_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The benefit of some kind word or deed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For, destitute of other aid, he much<br></span>
<span class="i0">His father’s tedious absence mourns at home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So fares Telemachus; his father strays<br></span>
<span class="i0">Remote, and, in his stead, no friend hath he<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who might avert the mischiefs that he feels.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom the Hero amber-hair’d replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ye Gods! the offspring of indeed a friend<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath reach’d my house, of one who hath endured<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arduous conflicts num’rous for my sake; <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l210" id="BIV_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And much I purpos’d, had Olympian Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Vouchsaf’d us prosp’rous passage o’er the Deep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To have receiv’d him with such friendship here<br></span>
<span class="i0">As none beside. In Argos I had then<br></span>
<span class="i0">Founded a city for him, and had rais’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">A palace for himself; I would have brought<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Hero hither, and his son, with all<br></span>
<span class="i0">His people, and with all his wealth, some town<br></span>
<span class="i0">Evacuating for his sake, of those<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ruled by myself, and neighb’ring close my own. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l220" id="BIV_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus situate, we had often interchanged<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet converse, nor had other cause at last<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our friendship terminated or our joys,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Than death’s black cloud o’ershadowing him or me.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But such delights could only envy move<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ev’n in the Gods, who have, of all the Greeks,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amerc’d <i>him</i> only of his wish’d return.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he kindled the desire to weep<br></span>
<span class="i0">In ev’ry bosom. Argive Helen wept<br></span>
<span class="i0">Abundant, Jove’s own daughter; wept as fast <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l230" id="BIV_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus and Menelaus both;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Nestor’s son with tearless eyes remain’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Calling to mind Antilochus<a name="fnm_11" id="fnm_11"></a><a href="#fn_11" class="fnnum">11</a> by the son<a name="fnm_12" id="fnm_12"></a><a href="#fn_12" class="fnnum">12</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">Illustrious of the bright Aurora slain,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rememb’ring whom, in accents wing’d he said.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Atrides! antient Nestor, when of late<br></span>
<span class="i0">Conversing with him, we remember’d thee,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pronounced thee wise beyond all human-kind.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now therefore, let not even my advice<br></span>
<span class="i0">Displease thee. It affords me no delight <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l240" id="BIV_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To intermingle tears with my repast,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And soon, Aurora, daughter of the dawn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will tinge the orient. Not that I account<br></span>
<span class="i0">Due lamentation of a friend deceased<br></span>
<span class="i0">Blameworthy, since, to sheer the locks and weep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is all we can for the unhappy dead.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I also have my grief, call’d to lament<br></span>
<span class="i0">One, not the meanest of Achaia’s sons,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My brother; him I cannot but suppose<br></span>
<span class="i0">To thee well-known, although unknown to me <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l250" id="BIV_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">Antilochus superior to the most,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In speed superior, and in feats of arms.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom, the Hero of the yellow locks.<br></span>
<span class="i0">O friend belov’d! since nought which thou hast said<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or recommended now, would have disgraced<br></span>
<span class="i0">A man of years maturer far than thine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(For wise thy father is, and such art thou,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And easy is it to discern the son<br></span>

<span class="i0">In marriage both and at his birth ordain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To great felicity; for he hath giv’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Nestor gradually to sink at home<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into old age, and, while he lives, to see<br></span>
<span class="i0">His sons past others wise, and skill’d in arms)<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sorrow into which we sudden fell<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall pause. Come—now remember we the feast;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pour water on our hands, for we shall find,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Telemachus and I) no dearth of themes<br></span>
<span class="i0">For mutual converse when the day shall dawn. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l270" id="BIV_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended; then, Asphalion, at his word,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Servant of glorious Menelaus, poured<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pure water on their hands, and they the feast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before them with keen appetite assail’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But Jove-born Helen otherwise, meantime,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Employ’d, into the wine of which they drank<br></span>
<span class="i0">A drug infused, antidote to the pains<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of grief and anger, a most potent charm<br></span>
<span class="i0">For ills of ev’ry name. Whoe’er his wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">So medicated drinks, he shall not pour <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l280" id="BIV_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>

<span class="i1">Atrides! Menelaus! dear to Jove!<br></span>
<span class="i0">These also are the sons of Chiefs renown’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(For Jove, as pleases him, to each assigns<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or good or evil, whom all things obey)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now therefore, feasting at your ease reclin’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Listen with pleasure, for myself, the while, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l300" id="BIV_l300"></a>300</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Will matter seasonable interpose.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot all rehearse, nor even name,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Omitting none) the conflicts and exploits<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of brave Ulysses; but with what address<br></span>
<span class="i0">Successful, one atchievement he perform’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">At Ilium, where Achaia’s sons endured<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such hardship, will I speak. Inflicting wounds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dishonourable on himself, he took<br></span>
<span class="i0">A tatter’d garb, and like a serving-man<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enter’d the spacious city of your foes. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l310" id="BIV_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">So veil’d, some mendicant he seem’d, although<br></span>
<span class="i0">No Greecian less deserved that name than he.<br></span>
<span class="i0">In such disguise he enter’d; all alike<br></span>
<span class="i0">Misdeem’d him; me alone he not deceived<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who challeng’d him, but, shrewd, he turn’d away.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At length, however, when I had myself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bathed him, anointed, cloath’d him, and had sworn<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not to declare him openly in Troy<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till he should reach again the camp and fleet,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He told me the whole purpose of the Greeks. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l320" id="BIV_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, (many a Trojan slaughter’d,) he regain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The camp, and much intelligence he bore<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the Achaians. Oh what wailing then<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was heard of Trojan women! but my heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exulted, alter’d now, and wishing home;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For now my crime committed under force<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Venus’ influence I deplored, what time<br></span>
<span class="i0">She led me to a country far remote,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A wand’rer from the matrimonial bed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">From my own child, and from my rightful Lord <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l330" id="BIV_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Alike unblemish’d both in form and mind.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Her answer’d then the Hero golden-hair’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Helen! thou hast well spoken. All is true.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I have the talents fathom’d and the minds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of num’rous Heroes, and have travell’d far<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet never saw I with these eyes in man<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such firmness as the calm Ulysses own’d;<br></span>
<span class="i0">None such as in the wooden horse he proved,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where all our bravest sat, designing woe<br></span>
<span class="i0">And bloody havoc for the sons of Troy. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l340" id="BIV_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou thither cam’st, impell’d, as it should seem,<br></span>
<span class="i0">By some divinity inclin’d to give<br></span>
<span class="i0">Victory to our foes, and with thee came<br></span>
<span class="i0">Godlike Deiphobus. Thrice round about<br></span>
<span class="i0">The hollow ambush, striking with thy hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Its sides thou went’st, and by his name didst call<br></span>
<span class="i0">Each prince of Greece feigning his consort’s voice.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself with Diomede, and with divine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, seated in the midst, the call<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heard plain and loud; we (Diomede and I) <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l350" id="BIV_l350"></a>350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With ardour burn’d either to quit the horse<br></span>
<span class="i0">So summon’d, or to answer from within.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, all impatient as we were, Ulysses<br></span>
<span class="i0">Controul’d the rash design; so there the sons<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Achaians silent sat and mute,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And of us all Anticlus would alone<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have answer’d; but Ulysses with both hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">Compressing close his lips, saved us, nor ceased<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till Pallas thence conducted thee again.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then thus, discrete, Telemachus replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l360" id="BIV_l360"></a>360</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Atrides! Menelaus! prince renown’d!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hard was his lot whom these rare qualities<br></span>
<span class="i0">Preserved not, neither had his dauntless heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">Been iron, had he scaped his cruel doom.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But haste, dismiss us hence, that on our beds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reposed, we may enjoy sleep, needful now.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceas’d; then Argive Helen gave command<br></span>
<span class="i0">To her attendant maidens to prepare<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beds in the portico with purple rugs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Resplendent, and with arras, overspread, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l370" id="BIV_l370"></a>370</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And cover’d warm with cloaks of shaggy pile.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forth went the maidens, bearing each a torch,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And spread the couches; next, the herald them<br></span>
<span class="i0">Led forth, and in the vestibule the son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Nestor and the youthful Hero slept,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus; but in the interior house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Atrides, with the loveliest of her sex<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside him, Helen of the sweeping stole.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Glow’d in the East, then from his couch arose <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l380" id="BIV_l380"></a>380</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The warlike Menelaus, fresh attir’d;<br></span>
<span class="i0">His faulchion o’er his shoulders slung, he bound<br></span>
<span class="i0">His sandals fair to his unsullied feet,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And like a God issuing, at the side<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sat of Telemachus, to whom he spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Hero! Telemachus! what urgent cause<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath hither led thee, to the land far-famed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Lacedæmon o’er the spacious Deep?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Public concern or private? Tell me true.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Telemachus discrete replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l390" id="BIV_l390"></a>390</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Atrides! Menelaus! prince renown’d!<br></span>
<span class="i0">News seeking of my Sire, I have arrived.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My household is devour’d, my fruitful fields<br></span>
<span class="i0">Are desolated, and my palace fill’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With enemies, who while they mutual wage<br></span>
<span class="i0">Proud competition for my mother’s love,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My flocks continual slaughter, and my beeves.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For this cause, at thy knees suppliant, I beg<br></span>
<span class="i0">That thou wouldst tell me his disastrous end,<br></span>
<span class="i0">If either thou beheld’st with thine own eyes <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l400" id="BIV_l400"></a>400</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His death, or from some wand’rer of the Greeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hast heard it; for no common woes, alas!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was he ordain’d to share ev’n from the womb.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Neither through pity or o’erstrain’d respect<br></span>
<span class="i0">Flatter me, but explicit all relate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which thou hast witness’d. If my noble Sire<br></span>
<span class="i0">E’er gratified thee by performance just<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of word or deed at Ilium, where ye fell<br></span>
<span class="i0">So num’rous slain in fight, oh recollect<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now his fidelity, and tell me true! <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l410" id="BIV_l410"></a>410</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Then Menelaus, sighing deep, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gods! their ambition is to reach the bed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of a brave man, however base themselves.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But as it chances, when the hart hath lay’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her fawns new-yean’d and sucklings yet, to rest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within some dreadful lion’s gloomy den,<br></span>
<span class="i0">She roams the hills, and in the grassy vales<br></span>
<span class="i0">Feeds heedless, till the lion, to his lair<br></span>
<span class="i0">Return’d, destroys her and her little-ones,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So them thy Sire shall terribly destroy. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l420" id="BIV_l420"></a>420</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Jove, Pallas and Apollo! oh that such<br></span>
<span class="i0">As erst in well-built Lesbos, where he strove<br></span>
<span class="i0">With Philomelides, and threw him flat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A sight at which Achaia’s sons rejoic’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such, now, Ulysses might assail them all!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Short life and bitter nuptials should be theirs.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But thy enquiries neither indirect<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will I evade, nor give thee false reply,<br></span>

<span class="i1">As yet the Gods on Ægypt’s shore detained<br></span>
<span class="i0">Me wishing home, angry at my neglect<br></span>
<span class="i0">To heap their altars with slain hecatombs.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For they exacted from us evermore<br></span>
<span class="i0">Strict rev’rence of their laws. There is an isle<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the billowy flood, Pharos by name,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In front of Ægypt, distant from her shore<br></span>
<span class="i0">Far as a vessel by a sprightly gale<br></span>
<span class="i0">Impell’d, may push her voyage in a day.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The haven there is good, and many a ship <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l440" id="BIV_l440"></a>440</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Finds wat’ring there from riv’lets on the coast.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There me the Gods kept twenty days, no breeze<br></span>

<span class="i0">And now had our provision, all consumed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Left us exhausted, but a certain nymph<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pitying saved me. Daughter fair was she<br></span>

<span class="i0">Idothea named; her most my sorrows moved;<br></span>
<span class="i0">She found me from my followers all apart <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l450" id="BIV_l450"></a>450</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Wand’ring (for they around the isle, with hooks<br></span>
<span class="i0">The fishes snaring roamed, by famine urged)<br></span>
<span class="i0">And standing at my side, me thus bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Stranger! thou must be ideot born, or weak<br></span>

<span class="i1">So spake the Goddess, and I thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I tell thee, whosoever of the Pow’rs <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l460" id="BIV_l460"></a>460</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">Yet say (for the Immortals all things know)<br></span>
<span class="i0">What God detains me, and my course forbids<br></span>

<span class="i0">My father; him if thou art able once<br></span>
<span class="i0">To seize and bind, he will prescribe the course<br></span>
<span class="i0">With all its measured distances, by which<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt regain secure thy native shores.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He will, moreover, at thy suit declare,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou favour’d of the skies! what good, what ill<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath in thine house befall’n, while absent thou<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy voyage difficult perform’st and long. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l480" id="BIV_l480"></a>480</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">She spake, and I replied—Thyself reveal<br></span>
<span class="i0">By what effectual bands I may secure<br></span>
<span class="i0">The antient Deity marine, lest, warn’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of my approach, he shun me and escape.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hard task for mortal hands to bind a God!<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then thus Idothea answer’d all-divine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will inform thee true. Soon as the sun<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath climb’d the middle heav’ns, the prophet old,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Emerging while the breezy zephyr blows,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And cover’d with the scum of ocean, seeks <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l490" id="BIV_l490"></a>490</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His spacious cove, in which outstretch’d he lies.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The phocæ<a name="fnm_15" id="fnm_15"></a><a href="#fn_15" class="fnnum">15</a> also, rising from the waves,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Offspring of beauteous Halosydna, sleep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Around him, num’rous, and the fishy scent<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exhaling rank of the unfathom’d flood.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thither conducting thee at peep of day<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will dispose thee in some safe recess,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But from among thy followers thou shalt chuse<br></span>
<span class="i0">The bravest three in all thy gallant fleet.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now the artifices understand <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l500" id="BIV_l500"></a>500</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the old prophet of the sea. The sum<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all his phocæ numb’ring duly first,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He will pass through them, and when all by fives<br></span>
<span class="i0">He counted hath, will in the midst repose<br></span>
<span class="i0">Content, as sleeps the shepherd with his flock.<br></span>
<span class="i0">When ye shall see him stretch’d, then call to mind<br></span>
<span class="i0">That moment all your prowess, and prevent,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Howe’er he strive impatient, his escape.<br></span>
<span class="i0">All changes trying, he will take the form<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of ev’ry reptile on the earth, will seem <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l510" id="BIV_l510"></a>510</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A river now, and now devouring fire;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But hold him ye, and grasp him still the more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And when himself shall question you, restored<br></span>
<span class="i0">To his own form in which ye found him first<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reposing, then from farther force abstain;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, Hero! loose the Antient of the Deep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And ask him, of the Gods who checks thy course<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hence to thy country o’er the fishy flood.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, she plunged into the billowy waste.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I then, in various musings lost, my ships <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l520" id="BIV_l520"></a>520</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Along the sea-beach station’d sought again,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And when I reach’d my galley on the shore<br></span>
<span class="i0">We supp’d, and sacred night falling from heav’n,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slept all extended on the ocean-side.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Look’d rosy forth, pensive beside the shore<br></span>
<span class="i0">I walk’d of Ocean, frequent to the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Praying devout, then chose the fittest three<br></span>
<span class="i0">For bold assault, and worthiest of my trust.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the Goddess from the bosom wide <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l530" id="BIV_l530"></a>530</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ocean rising, brought us thence four skins<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of phocæ, and all newly stript, a snare<br></span>
<span class="i0">Contriving subtle to deceive her Sire.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Four cradles in the sand she scoop’d, then sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Expecting us, who in due time approach’d;<br></span>
<span class="i0">She lodg’d us side by side, and over each<br></span>
<span class="i0">A raw skin cast. Horrible to ourselves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Proved that disguise whom the pernicious scent<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the sea-nourish’d phocæ sore annoy’d;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For who would lay him down at a whale’s side? <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l540" id="BIV_l540"></a>540</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But she a potent remedy devised<br></span>
<span class="i0">Herself to save us, who the nostrils sooth’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of each with pure ambrosia thither brought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Odorous, which the fishy scent subdued.<br></span>
<span class="i0">All morning, patient watchers, there we lay;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now the num’rous phocæ from the Deep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Emerging, slept along the shore, and he<br></span>
<span class="i0">At noon came also, and perceiving there<br></span>
<span class="i0">His fatted monsters, through the flock his course<br></span>
<span class="i0">Took regular, and summ’d them; with the first <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l550" id="BIV_l550"></a>550</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">He number’d us, suspicion none of fraud<br></span>
<span class="i0">Conceiving, then couch’d also. We, at once,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Loud-shouting flew on him, and in our arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Constrain’d him fast; nor the sea-prophet old<br></span>
<span class="i0">Call’d not incontinent his shifts to mind.<br></span>
<span class="i0">First he became a long-maned lion grim,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then dragon, panther then, a savage boar,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A limpid stream, and an o’ershadowing tree.<br></span>
<span class="i0">We persevering held him, till at length<br></span>

<span class="i0">In wiles, yet weary, question’d me, and said.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Oh Atreus’ son, by what confed’rate God<br></span>
<span class="i0">Instructed liest thou in wait for me,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To seize and hold me? what is thy desire?<br></span>
<span class="i1">So He; to whom thus answer I return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Old Seer! thou know’st; why, fraudful, should’st thou ask?<br></span>
<span class="i0">It is because I have been prison’d long<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within this isle, whence I have sought in vain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deliv’rance, till my wonted courage fails.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet say (for the Immortals all things know) <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l570" id="BIV_l570"></a>570</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">What God detains me, and my course forbids<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hence to my country o’er the fishy Deep?<br></span>
<span class="i1">So I; when thus the old one of the waves.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But thy plain duty<a name="fnm_16" id="fnm_16"></a><a href="#fn_16" class="fnnum">16</a> was to have adored<br></span>
<span class="i0">Jove, first, in sacrifice, and all the Gods,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That then embarking, by propitious gales<br></span>
<span class="i0">Impell’d, thou might’st have reach’d thy country soon.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For thou art doom’d ne’er to behold again<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy friends, thy palace, or thy native shores,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till thou have seen once more the hallow’d flood <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l580" id="BIV_l580"></a>580</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ægypt, and with hecatombs adored<br></span>
<span class="i0">Devout, the deathless tenants of the skies.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then will they speed thee whither thou desir’st.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, and my heart broke at his words,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which bade me pass again the gloomy gulph<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Ægypt; tedious course, and hard to atchieve!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, though in sorrow whelm’d, I thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Old prophet! I will all thy will perform.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But tell me, and the truth simply reveal;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have the Achaians with their ships arrived <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l590" id="BIV_l590"></a>590</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">Or in their followers’ arms found a dire death<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unlook’d for, since that city’s siege we closed?<br></span>
<span class="i1">I spake, when answer thus the God return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Atrides, why these questions? Need is none<br></span>
<span class="i0">That thou should’st all my secrets learn, which once<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reveal’d, thou would’st not long dry-eyed remain.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of those no few have died, and many live;<br></span>

<span class="i0">Have died (thou also hast had war to wage)<br></span>
<span class="i0">And one, still living, roams the boundless sea.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ajax,<a name="fnm_17" id="fnm_17"></a><a href="#fn_17" class="fnnum">17</a> surrounded by his galleys, died.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Him Neptune, first, against the bulky rocks<br></span>

<span class="i0">Nor had he perish’d, hated as he was<br></span>
<span class="i0">By Pallas, but for his own impious boast<br></span>
<span class="i0">In frenzy utter’d that he would escape<br></span>
<span class="i0">The billows, even in the Gods’ despight.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Neptune that speech vain-glorious hearing, grasp’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l610" id="BIV_l610"></a>610</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His trident, and the huge Gyræan rock<br></span>
<span class="i0">Smiting indignant, dash’d it half away;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Part stood, and part, on which the boaster sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">When, first, the brainsick fury seiz’d him, fell,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing him with it down into the gulphs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ocean, where he drank the brine, and died.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But thy own brother in his barks escaped<br></span>
<span class="i0">That fate, by Juno saved; yet when, at length,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He should have gain’d Malea’s craggy shore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, by a sudden tempest caught, he flew <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l620" id="BIV_l620"></a>620</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With many a groan far o’er the fishy Deep<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the land’s utmost point, where once his home<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thyestes had, but where Thyestes’ son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dwelt then, Ægisthus. Easy lay his course<br></span>
<span class="i0">And open thence, and, as it pleased the Gods,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The shifted wind soon bore them to their home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He, high in exultation, trod the shore<br></span>
<span class="i0">That gave him birth, kiss’d it, and, at the sight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The welcome sight of Greece, shed many a tear.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet not unseen he landed; for a spy, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l630" id="BIV_l630"></a>630</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">One whom the shrewd Ægisthus had seduced<br></span>
<span class="i0">By promise of two golden talents, mark’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">His coming from a rock where he had watch’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The year complete, lest, passing unperceived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The King should reassert his right in arms.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Swift flew the spy with tidings to this Lord,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And He, incontinent, this project framed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Insidious. Twenty men, the boldest hearts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the people, from the rest he chose,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom he in ambush placed, and others charged <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l640" id="BIV_l640"></a>640</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Diligent to prepare the festal board.<br></span>
<span class="i0">With horses, then, and chariots forth he drove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Full-fraught with mischief, and conducting home<br></span>
<span class="i0">The unsuspicious King, amid the feast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slew him, as at his crib men slay an ox.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor of thy brother’s train, nor of his train<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who slew thy brother, one survived, but all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Welt’ring in blood together, there expired.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, and his words beat on my heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">As they would break it. On the sands I sat <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l650" id="BIV_l650"></a>650</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Weeping, nor life nor light desiring more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when I had in dust roll’d me, and wept<br></span>
<span class="i0">To full satiety, mine ear again<br></span>
<span class="i0">The oracle of Ocean thus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Sit not, O son of Atreus! weeping here<br></span>
<span class="i0">Longer, for remedy can none be found;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But quick arising, trial make, how best<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt, and soonest, reach thy home again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For either him still living thou shalt find,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or ere thou come, Orestes shall have slain <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l660" id="BIV_l660"></a>660</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The traytor, and thine eyes shall see his tomb.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceas’d, and I, afflicted as I was,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet felt my spirit at that word refresh’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in wing’d accents answer thus return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Of these I am inform’d; but name the third<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, dead or living, on the boundless Deep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is still detain’d; I dread, yet wish to hear.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So I; to whom thus Proteus in return.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laertes’ son, the Lord of Ithaca—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Him in an island weeping I beheld, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l670" id="BIV_l670"></a>670</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Guest of the nymph Calypso, by constraint<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her guest, and from his native land withheld<br></span>
<span class="i0">By sad necessity; for ships well-oar’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or faithful followers hath he none, whose aid<br></span>
<span class="i0">Might speed him safely o’er the spacious flood.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, Menelaus dear to Jove! thy fate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ordains not thee the stroke of death to meet<br></span>
<span class="i0">In steed-fam’d Argos, but far hence the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will send thee to Elysium, and the earth’s<br></span>

<span class="i0">For that fair Helen is by nuptial bands<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy own, and thou art son-in-law of Jove.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he plunged into the billowy waste,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I then, with my brave comrades to the fleet<br></span>
<span class="i0">Return’d, deep-musing as I went, and sad. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l690" id="BIV_l690"></a>690</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">No sooner had I reach’d my ship beside<br></span>

<span class="i0">On board returning, thresh’d the foamy flood.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Once more, at length, within the hallow’d stream <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l700" id="BIV_l700"></a>700</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">With such a gale from heaven vouchsafed, as sent<br></span>
<span class="i0">My ships swift-scudding to the shores of Greece.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But come—eleven days wait here, or twelve<br></span>

<span class="i0">Long time; for though contented I could sit<br></span>

<span class="i0">Smooth course commodious and expanse of meads,<br></span>

<span class="i0">There sat Antinoüs, and the godlike youth <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l760" id="BIV_l760"></a>760</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Eurymachus, superior to the rest<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Chiefs among them, to whom Phronius’ son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Noëmon drawing nigh, with anxious mien<br></span>
<span class="i0">Question’d Antinoüs, and thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Know we, Antinoüs! or know we not,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When to expect Telemachus at home<br></span>
<span class="i0">Again from Pylus? in my ship he went,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which now I need, that I may cross the sea<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Elis, on whose spacious plain I feed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Twelve mares, each suckling a mule-colt as yet <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l770" id="BIV_l770"></a>770</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Unbroken, but of which I purpose one<br></span>
<span class="i0">To ferry thence, and break him into use.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake, whom they astonish’d heard; for him<br></span>
<span class="i0">They deem’d not to Nelëian Pylus gone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But haply into his own fields, his flocks<br></span>
<span class="i0">To visit, or the steward of his swine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus, Eupithes’ son, Antinoüs, spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Say true. When sail’d he forth? of all our youth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom chose he for his followers? his own train<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of slaves and hirelings? hath he pow’r to effect <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l780" id="BIV_l780"></a>780</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">This also? Tell me too, for I would learn—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Took he perforce thy sable bark away,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or gav’st it to him at his first demand?<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Noëmon, Phronius’ son, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I gave it voluntary; what could’st thou,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should such a prince petition for thy bark<br></span>
<span class="i0">In such distress? Hard were it to refuse.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Brave youths (our bravest youths except yourselves)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attend him forth; and with them I observed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mentor embarking, ruler o’er them all, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l790" id="BIV_l790"></a>790</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Or, if not him, a God; for such he seem’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But this much moves my wonder. Yester-morn<br></span>
<span class="i0">I saw, at day-break, noble Mentor here,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom shipp’d for Pylus I had seen before.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceas’d; and to his father’s house return’d;<br></span>
<span class="i0">They, hearing, sat aghast. Their games meantime<br></span>
<span class="i0">Finish’d, the suitors on their seats reposed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To whom Eupithes’ son, Antinoüs, next,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Much troubled spake; a black storm overcharged<br></span>
<span class="i0">His bosom, and his vivid eyes flash’d fire. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l800" id="BIV_l800"></a>800</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Ye Gods, a proud exploit is here atchieved,<br></span>
<span class="i0">This voyage of Telemachus, by us<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pronounced impracticable; yet the boy<br></span>
<span class="i0">In downright opposition to us all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath headlong launched a ship, and, with a band<br></span>
<span class="i0">Selected from our bravest youth, is gone.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He soon will prove more mischievous, whose pow’r<br></span>
<span class="i0">Jove wither, ere we suffer its effects!<br></span>
<span class="i0">But give me a swift bark with twenty rowers,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That, watching his return within the streights <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l810" id="BIV_l810"></a>810</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of rocky Samos and of Ithaca,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I may surprise him; so shall he have sail’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To seek his Sire, fatally for himself.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceased and loud applause heard in reply,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With warm encouragement. Then, rising all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into Ulysses’ house at once they throng’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor was Penelope left uninformed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Long time of their clandestine plottings deep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For herald Medon told her all, whose ear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their councils caught while in the outer-court <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l820" id="BIV_l820"></a>820</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">He stood, and they that project framed within.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Swift to Penelope the tale he bore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who as he pass’d the gate, him thus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">For what cause, herald! have the suitors sent<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thee foremost? Wou’d they that my maidens lay<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their tasks aside, and dress the board for them?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here end their wooing! may they hence depart<br></span>
<span class="i0">Never, and may the banquet now prepared,<br></span>
<span class="i0">This banquet prove your last!<a name="fnm_19" id="fnm_19"></a><a href="#fn_19" class="fnnum">19</a> who in such throngs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here meeting, waste the patrimony fair <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l830" id="BIV_l830"></a>830</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of brave Telemachus; ye never, sure,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When children, heard how gracious and how good<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses dwelt among your parents, none<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all his people, or in word or deed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Injuring, as great princes oft are wont,<br></span>
<span class="i0">By favour influenc’d now, now by disgust.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He no man wrong’d at any time; but plain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Your wicked purpose in your deeds appears,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who sense have none of benefits conferr’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then Medon answer’d thus, prudent, return’d. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l840" id="BIV_l840"></a>840</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh Queen! may the Gods grant this prove the worst.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But greater far and heavier ills than this<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors plan, whose counsels Jove confound!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their base desire and purpose are to slay<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus on his return; for he,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To gather tidings of his Sire is gone<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Pylus, or to Sparta’s land divine.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said; and where she stood, her trembling knees<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fail’d under her, and all her spirits went.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Speechless she long remain’d, tears filled her eyes, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l850" id="BIV_l850"></a>850</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And inarticulate in its passage died<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her utt’rance, till at last with pain she spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Herald! why went my son? he hath no need<br></span>
<span class="i0">On board swift ships to ride, which are to man<br></span>
<span class="i0">His steeds that bear him over seas remote.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Went he, that, with himself, his very name<br></span>
<span class="i0">Might perish from among mankind for ever?<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer, thus, Medon the wise return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I know not whether him some God impell’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or his own heart to Pylus, there to hear <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l860" id="BIV_l860"></a>860</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">News of his Sire’s return, or by what fate<br></span>
<span class="i0">At least he died, if he return no more.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and traversing Ulysses’ courts,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Departed; she with heart consuming woe<br></span>
<span class="i0">O’erwhelm’d, no longer could endure to take<br></span>
<span class="i0">Repose on any of her num’rous seats,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But on the threshold of her chamber-door<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lamenting sat, while all her female train<br></span>
<span class="i0">Around her moan’d, the antient and the young,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom, sobbing, thus Penelope bespake. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l870" id="BIV_l870"></a>870</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Hear me, ye maidens! for of women born<br></span>
<span class="i0">Coeval with me, none hath e’er received<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such plenteous sorrow from the Gods as I,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who first my noble husband lost, endued<br></span>
<span class="i0">With courage lion-like, of all the Greeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Chief with ev’ry virtue most adorn’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A prince all-excellent, whose glorious praise<br></span>
<span class="i0">Through Hellas and all Argos flew diffused.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now, my darling son,—him storms have snatch’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Far hence inglorious, and I knew it not. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l880" id="BIV_l880"></a>880</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ah treach’rous servants! conscious as ye were<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of his design, not one of you the thought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Conceived to wake me when he went on board.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For had but the report once reach’d my ear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He either had not gone (how much soe’er<br></span>
<span class="i0">He wish’d to leave me) or had left me dead.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But haste ye,—bid my antient servant come,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dolion, whom (when I left my father’s house<br></span>
<span class="i0">He gave me, and whose office is to attend<br></span>
<span class="i0">My num’rous garden-plants) that he may seek <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l890" id="BIV_l890"></a>890</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">At once Laertes, and may tell him all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who may contrive some remedy, perchance,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or fit expedient, and shall come abroad<br></span>
<span class="i0">To weep before the men who wish to slay<br></span>
<span class="i0">Even the prince, godlike Ulysses’ son.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then thus the gentle Euryclea spake,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nurse of Telemachus. Alas! my Queen!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slay me, or spare, deal with me as thou wilt,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will confess the truth. I knew it all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I gave him all that he required from me. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l900" id="BIV_l900"></a>900</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Both wine and bread, and, at his bidding, swore<br></span>
<span class="i0">To tell thee nought in twelve whole days to come,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or till, enquiry made, thou should’st thyself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Learn his departure, lest thou should’st impair<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy lovely features with excess of grief.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But lave thyself, and, fresh attired, ascend<br></span>
<span class="i0">To thy own chamber, there, with all thy train,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To worship Pallas, who shall save, thenceforth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy son from death, what ills soe’er he meet.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Add not fresh sorrows to the present woes <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l910" id="BIV_l910"></a>910</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the old King, for I believe not yet<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arcesias’ race entirely by the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Renounced, but trust that there shall still be found<br></span>
<span class="i0">Among them, who shall dwell in royal state,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And reap the fruits of fertile fields remote.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, she hush’d her sorrow, and her eyes<br></span>
<span class="i0">No longer stream’d. Then, bathed and fresh attired,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Penelope ascended with her train<br></span>
<span class="i0">The upper palace, and a basket stored<br></span>
<span class="i0">With hallow’d cakes off’ring, to Pallas pray’d. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l920" id="BIV_l920"></a>920</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Hear matchless daughter of Jove Ægis-arm’d!<br></span>
<span class="i0">If ever wise Ulysses offer’d here<br></span>
<span class="i0">The thighs of fatted kine or sheep to thee,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now mindful of his piety, preserve<br></span>
<span class="i0">His darling son, and frustrate with a frown<br></span>
<span class="i0">The cruelty of these imperious guests!<br></span>
<span class="i1">She said, and wept aloud, whose earnest suit<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pallas received. And now the spacious hall<br></span>
<span class="i0">And gloomy passages with tumult rang<br></span>
<span class="i0">And clamour of that throng, when thus, a youth, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l930" id="BIV_l930"></a>930</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Insolent as his fellows, dared to speak.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Much woo’d and long, the Queen at length prepares<br></span>
<span class="i0">To chuse another mate,<a name="fnm_20" id="fnm_20"></a><a href="#fn_20" class="fnnum">20</a> and nought suspects<br></span>
<span class="i0">The bloody death to which her son is doom’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So he; but they, meantime, themselves remain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Untaught, what course the dread concern elsewhere<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had taken, whom Antinoüs thus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Sirs! one and all, I counsel you, beware<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of such bold boasting unadvised; lest one<br></span>
<span class="i0">O’erhearing you, report your words within. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l940" id="BIV_l940"></a>940</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">No—rather thus, in silence, let us move<br></span>
<span class="i0">To an exploit so pleasant to us all.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and twenty chose, the bravest there,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With whom he sought the galley on the shore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which drawing down into the deep, they placed<br></span>
<span class="i0">The mast and sails on board, and, sitting, next,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Each oar in order to its proper groove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unfurl’d and spread their canvas to the gale.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their bold attendants, then, brought them their arms,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And soon as in deep water they had moor’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l950" id="BIV_l950"></a>950</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The ship, themselves embarking, supp’d on board,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And watch’d impatient for the dusk of eve.<br></span>
<span class="i1">But when Penelope, the palace stairs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Remounting, had her upper chamber reach’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">There, unrefresh’d with either food or wine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">She lay’d her down, her noble son the theme<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all her thoughts, whether he should escape<br></span>
<span class="i0">His haughty foes, or perish by their hands.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Num’rous as are the lion’s thoughts, who sees,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not without fear, a multitude with toils <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l960" id="BIV_l960"></a>960</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Encircling him around, such num’rous thoughts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her bosom occupied, till sleep at length<br></span>
<span class="i0">Invading her, she sank in soft repose.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then Pallas, teeming with a new design,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Set forth an airy phantom in the form<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of fair Iphthima, daughter of the brave<br></span>
<span class="i0">Icarius, and Eumelus’ wedded wife<br></span>
<span class="i0">In Pheræ. Shaped like her the dream she sent<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into the mansion of the godlike Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, with kind purpose to abate <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l970" id="BIV_l970"></a>970</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The sighs and tears of sad Penelope.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ent’ring the chamber-portal, where the bolt<br></span>
<span class="i0">Secured it, at her head the image stood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thus, in terms compassionate, began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Sleep’st thou, distress’d Penelope? The Gods,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Happy in everlasting rest themselves,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forbid thy sorrows. Thou shalt yet behold<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy son again, who hath by no offence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Incurr’d at any time the wrath of heav’n.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom, sweet-slumb’ring in the shadowy gate <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l980" id="BIV_l980"></a>980</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">By which dreams pass, Penelope replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">What cause, my sister, brings thee, who art seen<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unfrequent here, for that thou dwell’st remote?<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thou enjoin’st me a cessation too<br></span>
<span class="i0">From sorrows num’rous, and which, fretting, wear<br></span>
<span class="i0">My heart continual; first, my spouse I lost<br></span>
<span class="i0">With courage lion-like endow’d, a prince<br></span>
<span class="i0">All-excellent, whose never-dying praise<br></span>
<span class="i0">Through Hellas and all Argos flew diffused;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now my only son, new to the toils <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l990" id="BIV_l990"></a>990</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And hazards of the sea, nor less untaught<br></span>
<span class="i0">The arts of traffic, in a ship is gone<br></span>
<span class="i0">Far hence, for whose dear cause I sorrow more<br></span>
<span class="i0">Than for his Sire himself, and even shake<br></span>
<span class="i0">With terror, lest he perish by their hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">To whom he goes, or in the stormy Deep;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For num’rous are his foes, and all intent<br></span>
<span class="i0">To slay him, ere he reach his home again.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer thus the shadowy form return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Take courage; suffer not excessive dread <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l1000" id="BIV_l1000"></a>1000</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To overwhelm thee, such a guide he hath<br></span>
<span class="i0">And guardian, one whom many wish their friend,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And ever at their side, knowing her pow’r,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Minerva; she compassionates thy griefs,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I am here her harbinger, who speak<br></span>
<span class="i0">As thou hast heard by her own kind command.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then thus Penelope the wise replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! if thou art a goddess, and hast heard<br></span>
<span class="i0">A Goddess’ voice, rehearse to me the lot<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of that unhappy one, if yet he live <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l1010" id="BIV_l1010"></a>1010</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Spectator of the cheerful beams of day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or if, already dead, he dwell below.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Whom answer’d thus the fleeting shadow vain.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will not now inform thee if thy Lord<br></span>
<span class="i0">Live, or live not. Vain words are best unspoken.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, her egress swift beside the bolt<br></span>
<span class="i0">She made, and melted into air. Upsprang<br></span>
<span class="i0">From sleep Icarius’ daughter, and her heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">Felt heal’d within her, by that dream distinct<br></span>
<span class="i0">Visited in the noiseless night serene. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIV_l1020" id="BIV_l1020"></a>1020</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Meantime the suitors urged their wat’ry way,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To instant death devoting in their hearts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus. There is a rocky isle<br></span>
<span class="i0">In the mid sea, Samos the rude between<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Ithaca, not large, named Asteris.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It hath commodious havens, into which<br></span>
<span class="i0">A passage clear opens on either side,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And there the ambush’d Greeks his coming watch’d.<br></span>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">Mercury bears to Calypso a command from Jupiter that she dismiss Ulysses.
She, after some remonstrances, promises obedience, and furnishes him with
instruments and materials, with which he constructs a raft. He quits
Calypso’s island; is persecuted by Neptune with dreadful tempests, but by
the assistance of a sea nymph, after having lost his raft, is enabled to
swim to Phæacia.</p>

<span class="i0">Amid them, Pallas on the num’rous woes<br></span>

<span class="i0">Alike of gallant barks and friends depriv’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who might conduct him o’er the spacious Deep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor is this all, but enemies combine<br></span>
<span class="i0">To slay his son ere yet he can return<br></span>
<span class="i0">From Pylus, whither he hath gone to learn<br></span>
<span class="i0">There, or in Sparta, tidings of his Sire.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom the cloud-assembler God replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">What word hath pass’d thy lips, daughter belov’d?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou not purpos’d that arriving soon<br></span>
<span class="i0">At home, Ulysses shall destroy his foes? <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l30" id="BV_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Guide thou, Telemachus, (for well thou canst)<br></span>
<span class="i0">That he may reach secure his native coast,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And that the suitors baffled may return.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceas’d, and thus to Hermes spake, his son.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hermes! (for thou art herald of our will<br></span>
<span class="i0">At all times) to yon bright-hair’d nymph convey<br></span>

<span class="i0">Borne on a corded raft, and suff’ring woe<br></span>
<span class="i0">Extreme, he on the twentieth day shall reach, <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l40" id="BV_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Not sooner, Scherie the deep-soil’d, possess’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">By the Phæacians, kinsmen of the Gods.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They, as a God shall reverence the Chief,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in a bark of theirs shall send him thence<br></span>
<span class="i0">To his own home, much treasure, brass and gold<br></span>
<span class="i0">And raiment giving him, to an amount<br></span>
<span class="i0">Surpassing all that, had he safe return’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He should by lot have shared of Ilium’s spoil.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Fate appoints Ulysses to regain<br></span>
<span class="i0">His country, his own palace, and his friends. <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l50" id="BV_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, nor the Argicide refused,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Messenger of the skies; his sandals fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ambrosial, golden, to his feet he bound,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which o’er the moist wave, rapid as the wind,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bear him, and o’er th’ illimitable earth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then took his rod with which, at will, all eyes<br></span>
<span class="i0">He closes soft, or opes them wide again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So arm’d, forth flew the valiant Argicide.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alighting on Pieria, down he stoop’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Ocean, and the billows lightly skimm’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l60" id="BV_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In form a sew-mew, such as in the bays<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tremendous of the barren Deep her food<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seeking, dips oft in brine her ample wing.<br></span>
<span class="i0">In such disguise o’er many a wave he rode,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But reaching, now, that isle remote, forsook<br></span>
<span class="i0">The azure Deep, and at the spacious grot,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where dwelt the amber-tressed nymph arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Found her within. A fire on all the hearth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Blazed sprightly, and, afar-diffused, the scent<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of smooth-split cedar and of cypress-wood <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l70" id="BV_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Odorous, burning, cheer’d the happy isle.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She, busied at the loom, and plying fast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her golden shuttle, with melodious voice<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sat chaunting there; a grove on either side,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alder and poplar, and the redolent branch<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wide-spread of Cypress, skirted dark the cave.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There many a bird of broadest pinion built<br></span>
<span class="i0">Secure her nest, the owl, the kite, and daw<br></span>
<span class="i0">Long-tongued, frequenter of the sandy shores.<br></span>
<span class="i0">A garden-vine luxuriant on all sides <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l80" id="BV_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Mantled the spacious cavern, cluster-hung<br></span>
<span class="i0">Profuse; four fountains of serenest lymph<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their sinuous course pursuing side by side,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stray’d all around, and ev’ry where appear’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meadows of softest verdure, purpled o’er<br></span>
<span class="i0">With violets; it was a scene to fill<br></span>
<span class="i0">A God from heav’n with wonder and delight.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hermes, Heav’n’s messenger, admiring stood<br></span>
<span class="i0">That sight, and having all survey’d, at length<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enter’d the grotto; nor the lovely nymph <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l90" id="BV_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Him knew not soon as seen, for not unknown<br></span>
<span class="i0">Each to the other the Immortals are,<br></span>
<span class="i0">How far soever sep’rate their abodes.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet found he not within the mighty Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses; he sat weeping on the shore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forlorn, for there his custom was with groans<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of sad regret t’ afflict his breaking heart.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Looking continual o’er the barren Deep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus Calypso, nymph divine, the God<br></span>
<span class="i0">Question’d, from her resplendent throne august. <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l100" id="BV_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Hermes! possessor of the potent rod!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, though by me much reverenc’d and belov’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So seldom com’st, say, wherefore comest now?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Speak thy desire; I grant it, if thou ask<br></span>
<span class="i0">Things possible, and possible to me.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stay not, but ent’ring farther, at my board<br></span>
<span class="i0">Due rites of hospitality receive.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, the Goddess with ambrosial food<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her table cover’d, and with rosy juice<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nectareous charged the cup. Then ate and drank <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l110" id="BV_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The argicide and herald of the skies,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in his soul with that repast divine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Refresh’d, his message to the nymph declared.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Questionest thou, O Goddess, me a God?<br></span>
<span class="i0">I tell thee truth, since such is thy demand.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not willing, but by Jove constrain’d, I come.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For who would, voluntary, such a breadth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enormous measure of the salt expanse,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where city none is seen in which the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Are served with chosen hecatombs and pray’r? <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l120" id="BV_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But no divinity may the designs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Elude, or controvert, of Jove supreme.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He saith, that here thou hold’st the most distrest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all those warriors who nine years assail’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The city of Priam, and, (that city sack’d)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Departed in the tenth; but, going thence,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Offended Pallas, who with adverse winds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Opposed their voyage, and with boist’rous waves.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then perish’d all his gallant friends, but him<br></span>
<span class="i0">Billows and storms drove hither; Jove commands <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l130" id="BV_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That thou dismiss him hence without delay,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For fate ordains him not to perish here<br></span>
<span class="i0">From all his friends remote, but he is doom’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To see them yet again, and to arrive<br></span>
<span class="i0">At his own palace in his native land.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said; divine Calypso at the sound<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shudder’d, and in wing’d accents thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ye are unjust, ye Gods, and envious past<br></span>
<span class="i0">All others, grudging if a Goddess take<br></span>
<span class="i0">A mortal man openly to her arms! <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l140" id="BV_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">So, when the rosy-finger’d Morning chose<br></span>
<span class="i0">Orion, though ye live yourselves at ease,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet ye all envied her, until the chaste<br></span>
<span class="i0">Diana from her golden throne dispatch’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">A silent shaft, which slew him in Ortygia.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So, when the golden-tressed Ceres, urged<br></span>
<span class="i0">By passion, took Iäsion to her arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">In a thrice-labour’d fallow, not untaught<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was Jove that secret long, and, hearing it,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Indignant, slew him with his candent bolt. <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l150" id="BV_l150"></a>150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">So also, O ye Gods, ye envy me<br></span>
<span class="i0">The mortal man, my comfort. Him I saved<br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself, while solitary on his keel<br></span>
<span class="i0">He rode, for with his sulph’rous arrow Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had cleft his bark amid the sable Deep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then perish’d all his gallant friends, but him<br></span>
<span class="i0">Billows and storms drove hither, whom I lov’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sincere, and fondly destin’d to a life<br></span>
<span class="i0">Immortal, unobnoxious to decay.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But since no Deity may the designs <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l160" id="BV_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Elude or controvert of Jove supreme,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hence with him o’er the barren Deep, if such<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Sov’reign’s will, and such his stern command.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But undismiss’d he goes by me, who ships<br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself well-oar’d and mariners have none<br></span>
<span class="i0">To send with him athwart the spacious flood;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet freely, readily, my best advice<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will afford him, that, escaping all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Danger, he may regain his native shore.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then Hermes thus, the messenger of heav’n. <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l170" id="BV_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Act as thou say’st, fearing the frown of Jove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lest, if provoked, he spare not even thee.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, the dauntless Argicide withdrew,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And she (Jove’s mandate heard) all-graceful went,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seeking the brave Ulysses; on the shore<br></span>
<span class="i0">She found him seated; tears succeeding tears<br></span>
<span class="i0">Delug’d his eyes, while, hopeless of return,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Life’s precious hours to eating cares he gave<br></span>
<span class="i0">Continual, with the nymph now charm’d no more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, cold as she was am’rous, still he pass’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l180" id="BV_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His nights beside her in the hollow grot,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Constrain’d, and day by day the rocks among<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which lined the shore heart-broken sat, and oft<br></span>
<span class="i0">While wistfully he eyed the barren Deep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wept, groaned, desponded, sigh’d, and wept again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, drawing near, thus spake the nymph divine.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Unhappy! weep not here, nor life consume<br></span>
<span class="i0">In anguish; go; thou hast my glad consent.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arise to labour; hewing down the trunks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of lofty trees, fashion them with the ax <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l190" id="BV_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To a broad raft, which closely floor’d above,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall hence convey thee o’er the gloomy Deep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bread, water, and the red grape’s cheering juice<br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself will put on board, which shall preserve<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy life from famine; I will also give<br></span>
<span class="i0">New raiment for thy limbs, and will dispatch<br></span>
<span class="i0">Winds after thee to waft thee home unharm’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">If such the pleasure of the Gods who dwell<br></span>
<span class="i0">In yonder boundless heav’n, superior far<br></span>
<span class="i0">To me, in knowledge and in skill to judge. <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l200" id="BV_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">She ceas’d; but horror at that sound the heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">Chill’d of Ulysses, and in accents wing’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With wonder, thus the noble Chief replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ah! other thoughts than of my safe return<br></span>
<span class="i0">Employ thee, Goddess, now, who bid’st me pass<br></span>
<span class="i0">The perilous gulph of Ocean on a raft,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That wild expanse terrible, which even ships<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pass not, though form’d to cleave their way with ease,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And joyful in propitious winds from Jove.<br></span>
<span class="i0">No—let me never, in despight of thee, <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l210" id="BV_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Embark on board a raft, nor till thou swear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">O Goddess! the inviolable oath,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That future mischief thou intend’st me none.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said; Calypso, beauteous Goddess, smiled,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, while she spake, stroaking his cheek, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thou dost asperse me rudely, and excuse<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of ignorance hast none, far better taught;<br></span>
<span class="i0">What words were these? How could’st thou thus reply?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now hear me Earth, and the wide Heav’n above!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hear, too, ye waters of the Stygian stream <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l220" id="BV_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Under the earth (by which the blessed Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Swear trembling, and revere the awful oath!)<br></span>
<span class="i0">That future mischief I intend thee none.<br></span>
<span class="i0">No, my designs concerning thee are such<br></span>
<span class="i0">As, in an exigence resembling thine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself, most sure, should for myself conceive.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I have a mind more equal, not of steel<br></span>
<span class="i0">My heart is form’d, but much to pity inclined.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, the lovely Goddess with swift pace<br></span>
<span class="i0">Led on, whose footsteps he as swift pursued. <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l230" id="BV_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Within the vaulted cavern they arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Goddess and the man; on the same throne<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses sat, whence Hermes had aris’n,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And viands of all kinds, such as sustain<br></span>
<span class="i0">The life of mortal man, Calypso placed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before him, both for bev’rage and for food.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She opposite to the illustrious Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reposed, by her attendant maidens served<br></span>
<span class="i0">With nectar and ambrosia. They their hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stretch’d forth together to the ready feast, <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l240" id="BV_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And when nor hunger more nor thirst remain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unsated, thus the beauteous nymph began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Laertes’ noble son, for wisdom famed<br></span>
<span class="i0">And artifice! oh canst thou thus resolve<br></span>
<span class="i0">To seek, incontinent, thy native shores?<br></span>
<span class="i0">I pardon thee. Farewell! but could’st thou guess<br></span>
<span class="i0">The woes which fate ordains thee to endure<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ere yet thou reach thy country, well-content<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here to inhabit, thou would’st keep my grot<br></span>
<span class="i0">And be immortal, howsoe’er thy wife <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l250" id="BV_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Engage thy ev’ry wish day after day.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet can I not in stature or in form<br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself suspect inferior aught to her,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Since competition cannot be between<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mere mortal beauties, and a form divine.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Awful Divinity! be not incensed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I know that my Penelope in form<br></span>
<span class="i0">And stature altogether yields to thee,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For she is mortal, and immortal thou, <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l260" id="BV_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">From age exempt; yet not the less I wish<br></span>
<span class="i0">My home, and languish daily to return.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But should some God amid the sable Deep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dash me again into a wreck, my soul<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall bear <i>that</i> also; for, by practice taught,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I have learned patience, having much endured<br></span>
<span class="i0">By tempest and in battle both. Come then<br></span>
<span class="i0">This evil also! I am well prepared.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, and the sun sinking, resign’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The earth to darkness. Then in a recess <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l270" id="BV_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Interior of the cavern, side by side<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reposed, they took their amorous delight.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Look’d rosy forth, Ulysses then in haste<br></span>
<span class="i0">Put on his vest and mantle, and, the nymph<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her snowy vesture of transparent woof,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Graceful, redundant; to her waist she bound<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her golden zone, and veil’d her beauteous head,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, musing, plann’d the noble Chief’s return.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She gave him, fitted to the grasp, an ax <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l280" id="BV_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of iron, pond’rous, double-edg’d, with haft<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of olive-wood, inserted firm, and wrought<br></span>
<span class="i0">With curious art. Then, placing in his hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">A polish’d adze, she led, herself, the way<br></span>
<span class="i0">To her isles’ utmost verge, where tallest trees<br></span>
<span class="i0">But dry long since and sapless stood, which best<br></span>
<span class="i0">Might serve his purposes, as buoyant most,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The alder, poplar, and cloud-piercing fir.<br></span>
<span class="i0">To that tall grove she led and left him there,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seeking her grot again. Then slept not He, <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l290" id="BV_l290"></a>290</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But, swinging with both hands the ax, his task<br></span>
<span class="i0">Soon finish’d; trees full twenty to the ground<br></span>
<span class="i0">He cast, which, dext’rous, with his adze he smooth’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The knotted surface chipping by a line.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the lovely Goddess to his aid<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sharp augres brought, with which he bored the beams,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, side by side placing them, fitted each<br></span>
<span class="i0">To other, and with long cramps join’d them all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Broad as an artist, skill’d in naval works,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The bottom of a ship of burthen spreads, <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l300" id="BV_l300"></a>300</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Such breadth Ulysses to his raft assign’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He deck’d her over with long planks, upborne<br></span>
<span class="i0">On massy beams; He made the mast, to which<br></span>
<span class="i0">He added suitable the yard;—he framed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rudder and helm to regulate her course,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With wicker-work he border’d all her length<br></span>
<span class="i0">For safety, and much ballast stow’d within.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, Calypso brought him for a sail<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fittest materials, which he also shaped,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to his sail due furniture annex’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l310" id="BV_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of cordage strong, foot-ropes, and ropes aloft,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then heav’d her down with levers to the Deep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He finish’d all his work on the fourth day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And on the fifth, Calypso, nymph divine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dismiss’d him from her isle, but laved him first,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And cloath’d him in sweet-scented garments new.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Two skins the Goddess also placed on board,<br></span>
<span class="i0">One charg’d with crimson wine, and ampler one<br></span>
<span class="i0">With water, nor a bag with food replete<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forgot, nutritious, grateful to the taste, <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l320" id="BV_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet, her latest gift, a gentle gale<br></span>
<span class="i0">And manageable, which Ulysses spread,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exulting, all his canvas to receive.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the helm he sat, steering expert,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor sleep fell ever on his eyes that watch’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Intent the Pleiads, tardy in decline<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bootes, and the Bear, call’d else the Wain,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which, in his polar prison circling, looks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Direct toward Orion, and alone<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of these sinks never to the briny Deep. <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l330" id="BV_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That star the lovely Goddess bade him hold<br></span>
<span class="i0">Continual on his left through all his course.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ten days and sev’n, he, navigating, cleav’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The brine, and on the eighteenth day, at length,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The shadowy mountains of Phæacia’s land<br></span>
<span class="i0">Descried, where nearest to his course it lay<br></span>
<span class="i0">Like a broad buckler on the waves afloat.<br></span>
<span class="i1">But Neptune, now returning from the land<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ethiopia, mark’d him on his raft<br></span>
<span class="i0">Skimming the billows, from the mountain-tops <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l340" id="BV_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of distant Solyma.<a name="fnm_21" id="fnm_21"></a><a href="#fn_21" class="fnnum">21</a> With tenfold wrath<br></span>
<span class="i0">Inflamed that sight he view’d, his brows he shook,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thus within himself, indignant, spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So then—new counsels in the skies, it seems,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Propitious to Ulysses, have prevail’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Since Æthiopia hath been my abode.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He sees Phæacia nigh, where he must leap<br></span>
<span class="i0">The bound’ry of his woes; but ere that hour<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arrive, I will ensure him many a groan.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he grasp’d his trident, gather’d dense <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l350" id="BV_l350"></a>350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The clouds and troubled ocean; ev’ry storm<br></span>
<span class="i0">From ev’ry point he summon’d, earth and sea<br></span>
<span class="i0">Darkening, and the night fell black from heav’n.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The East, the South, the heavy-blowing West,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the cold North-wind clear, assail’d at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">His raft, and heaved on high the billowy flood.<br></span>
<span class="i0">All hope, all courage, in that moment, lost,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Hero thus within himself complain’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Wretch that I am, what destiny at last<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attends me! much I fear the Goddess’ words <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l360" id="BV_l360"></a>360</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">All true, which threaten’d me with num’rous ills<br></span>
<span class="i0">On the wide sea, ere I should reach my home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Behold them all fulfill’d! with what a storm<br></span>
<span class="i0">Jove hangs the heav’ns, and agitates the Deep!<br></span>
<span class="i0">The winds combined beat on me. Now I sink!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice blest, and more than thrice, Achaia’s sons<br></span>
<span class="i0">At Ilium slain for the Atridæ’ sake!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, would to heav’n that, dying, I had felt<br></span>
<span class="i0">That day the stroke of fate, when me the dead<br></span>
<span class="i0">Achilles guarding, with a thousand spears <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l370" id="BV_l370"></a>370</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Troy’s furious host assail’d! Funereal rites<br></span>
<span class="i0">I then had shared, and praise from ev’ry Greek,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom now the most inglorious death awaits.<br></span>
<span class="i1">While thus he spake, a billow on his head<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bursting impetuous, whirl’d the raft around,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, dashing from his grasp the helm, himself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Plunged far remote. Then came a sudden gust<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of mingling winds, that in the middle snapp’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">His mast, and, hurried o’er the waves afar,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both sail and sail-yard fell into the flood. <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l380" id="BV_l380"></a>380</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Long time submerged he lay, nor could with ease<br></span>
<span class="i0">The violence of that dread shock surmount,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or rise to air again, so burthensome<br></span>
<span class="i0">His drench’d apparel proved; but, at the last,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He rose, and, rising, sputter’d from his lips<br></span>
<span class="i0">The brine that trickled copious from his brows.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor, harass’d as he was, resign’d he yet<br></span>
<span class="i0">His raft, but buffetting the waves aside<br></span>
<span class="i0">With desp’rate efforts, seized it, and again<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fast seated on the middle deck, escaped. <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l390" id="BV_l390"></a>390</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then roll’d the raft at random in the flood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wallowing unwieldy, toss’d from wave to wave.<br></span>
<span class="i0">As when in autumn, Boreas o’er the plain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Conglomerated thorns before him drives,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They, tangled, to each other close adhere,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So her the winds drove wild about the Deep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">By turns the South consign’d her to be sport<br></span>
<span class="i0">For the rude North-wind, and, by turns, the East<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yielded her to the worrying West a prey.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But Cadmus’ beauteous daughter (Ino once, <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l400" id="BV_l400"></a>400</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Now named Leucothea) saw him; mortal erst<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was she, and trod the earth,<a name="fnm_22" id="fnm_22"></a><a href="#fn_22" class="fnnum">22</a> but nymph become<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ocean since, in honours shares divine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She mark’d his anguish, and, while toss’d he roam’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pitied Ulysses; from the flood, in form<br></span>
<span class="i0">A cormorant, she flew, and on the raft<br></span>
<span class="i0">Close-corded perching, thus the Chief address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Alas! unhappy! how hast thou incensed<br></span>
<span class="i0">So terribly the Shaker of the shores,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That he pursues thee with such num’rous ills? <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l410" id="BV_l410"></a>410</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Sink thee he cannot, wish it as he may.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus do (for I account thee not unwise)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy garments putting off, let drive thy raft<br></span>
<span class="i0">As the winds will, then, swimming, strive to reach<br></span>
<span class="i0">Phæacia, where thy doom is to escape.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Take this. This ribbon bind beneath thy breast,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Celestial texture. Thenceforth ev’ry fear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of death dismiss, and, laying once thy hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">On the firm continent, unbind the zone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which thou shalt cast far distant from the shore <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l420" id="BV_l420"></a>420</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Into the Deep, turning thy face away.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, the Goddess gave into his hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">The wond’rous zone, and, cormorant in form,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Plunging herself into the waves again<br></span>
<span class="i0">Headlong, was hidden by the closing flood.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But still Ulysses sat perplex’d, and thus<br></span>
<span class="i0">The toil-enduring Hero reason’d sad.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Alas! I tremble lest some God design<br></span>
<span class="i0">T’ ensnare me yet, bidding me quit the raft.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But let me well beware how I obey <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l430" id="BV_l430"></a>430</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Too soon that precept, for I saw the land<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of my foretold deliv’rance far remote.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, therefore, will I do, for such appears<br></span>
<span class="i0">My wiser course. So long as yet the planks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mutual adhere, continuing on board<br></span>
<span class="i0">My raft, I will endure whatever woes,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when the waves shall shatter it, I will swim,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My sole resource then left. While thus he mused,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Neptune a billow of enormous bulk<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hollow’d into an overwhelming arch <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l440" id="BV_l440"></a>440</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">On high up-heaving, smote him. As the wind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tempestuous, falling on some stubble-heap,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The arid straws dissipates ev’ry way,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So flew the timbers. He, a single beam<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bestriding, oar’d it onward with his feet,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As he had urged an horse. His raiment, then,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gift of Calypso, putting off, he bound<br></span>
<span class="i0">His girdle on, and prone into the sea<br></span>
<span class="i0">With wide-spread palms prepar’d for swimming, fell.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shore-shaker Neptune noted him; he shook <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l450" id="BV_l450"></a>450</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His awful brows, and in his heart he said,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus, suff’ring many mis’ries roam the flood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till thou shalt mingle with a race of men<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heav’n’s special favourites; yet even there<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fear not that thou shalt feel thy sorrows light.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and scourging his bright steeds, arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">At Ægæ, where his glorious palace stands.<br></span>
<span class="i1">But other thoughts Minerva’s mind employ’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Jove’s daughter; ev’ry wind binding beside,<br></span>
<span class="i0">She lull’d them, and enjoin’d them all to sleep, <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l460" id="BV_l460"></a>460</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But roused swift Boreas, and the billows broke<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before Ulysses, that, deliver’d safe<br></span>
<span class="i0">From a dire death, the noble Chief might mix<br></span>
<span class="i0">With maritime Phæacia’s sons renown’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Two nights he wander’d, and two days, the flood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tempestuous, death expecting ev’ry hour;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when Aurora, radiant-hair’d, had brought<br></span>
<span class="i0">The third day to a close, then ceas’d the wind,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And breathless came a calm; he, nigh at hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">The shore beheld, darting acute his sight <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l470" id="BV_l470"></a>470</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Toward it, from a billow’s tow’ring top.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Precious as to his children seems the life<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of some fond father through disease long time<br></span>
<span class="i0">And pain stretch’d languid on his couch, the prey<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of some vindictive Pow’r, but now, at last,<br></span>
<span class="i0">By gracious heav’n to ease and health restored,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So grateful to Ulysses’ sight appear’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forests and hills. Impatient with his feet<br></span>
<span class="i0">To press the shore, he swam; but when within<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such distance as a shout may fly, he came, <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l480" id="BV_l480"></a>480</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The thunder of the sea against the rocks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then smote his ear; for hoarse the billows roar’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">On the firm land, belch’d horrible abroad,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the salt spray dimm’d all things to his view.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For neither port for ships nor shelt’ring cove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was there, but the rude coast a headland bluff<br></span>
<span class="i0">Presented, rocks and craggy masses huge.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, hope and strength exhausted both, deep-groan’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Chief, and in his noble heart complain’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Alas! though Jove hath given me to behold, <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l490" id="BV_l490"></a>490</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Unhoped, the land again, and I have pass’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Furrowing my way, these num’rous waves, there seems<br></span>
<span class="i0">No egress from the hoary flood for me.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sharp stones hem in the waters; wild the surge<br></span>
<span class="i0">Raves ev’ry where; and smooth the rocks arise;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deep also is the shore, on which my feet<br></span>
<span class="i0">No standing gain, or chance of safe escape.<br></span>
<span class="i0">What if some billow catch me from the Deep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Emerging, and against the pointed rocks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dash me conflicting with its force in vain? <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l500" id="BV_l500"></a>500</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But should I, swimming, trace the coast in search<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of sloping beach, haven or shelter’d creek,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I fear lest, groaning, I be snatch’d again<br></span>
<span class="i0">By stormy gusts into the fishy Deep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or lest some monster of the flood receive<br></span>
<span class="i0">Command to seize me, of the many such<br></span>
<span class="i0">By the illustrious Amphitrite bred;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For that the mighty Shaker of the shores<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hates me implacable, too well I know.<br></span>
<span class="i1">While such discourse within himself he held, <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l510" id="BV_l510"></a>510</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A huge wave heav’d him on the rugged coast,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where flay’d his flesh had been, and all his bones<br></span>
<span class="i0">Broken together, but for the infused<br></span>
<span class="i0">Good counsel of Minerva azure-eyed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">With both hands suddenly he seized the rock,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, groaning, clench’d it till the billow pass’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So baffled he that wave; but yet again<br></span>
<span class="i0">The refluent flood rush’d on him, and with force<br></span>
<span class="i0">Resistless dash’d him far into the sea.<br></span>
<span class="i0">As pebbles to the hollow polypus <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l520" id="BV_l520"></a>520</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Extracted from his stony bed, adhere,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So he, the rough rocks clasping, stripp’d his hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">Raw, and the billows now whelm’d him again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then had the hapless Hero premature<br></span>
<span class="i0">Perish’d, but for sagacity inspired<br></span>
<span class="i0">By Pallas azure-eyed. Forth from the waves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Emerging, where the surf burst on the rocks,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He coasted (looking landward as he swam)<br></span>
<span class="i0">The shore, with hope of port or level beach.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when, still swimming, to the mouth he came <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l530" id="BV_l530"></a>530</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of a smooth-sliding river, there he deem’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Safest th’ ascent, for it was undeform’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">By rocks, and shelter’d close from ev’ry wind.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He felt the current, and thus, ardent, pray’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">O hear, whate’er thy name, Sov’reign, who rul’st<br></span>
<span class="i0">This river! at whose mouth, from all the threats<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Neptune ’scap’d, with rapture I arrive.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Even the Immortal Gods the wand’rer’s pray’r<br></span>
<span class="i0">Respect, and such am I, who reach, at length,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy stream, and clasp thy knees, after long toil. <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l540" id="BV_l540"></a>540</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I am thy suppliant. Oh King! pity me.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said; the river God at once repress’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">His current, and it ceas’d; smooth he prepared<br></span>
<span class="i0">The way before Ulysses, and the land<br></span>
<span class="i0">Vouchsafed him easy at his channel’s mouth.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There, once again he bent for ease his limbs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both arms and knees, in conflict with the floods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exhausted; swoln his body was all o’er,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And from his mouth and nostrils stream’d the brine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Breathless and speechless, and of life well nigh <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l550" id="BV_l550"></a>550</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Bereft he lay, through dreadful toil immense.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when, revived, his dissipated pow’rs<br></span>
<span class="i0">He recollected, loosing from beneath<br></span>
<span class="i0">His breast the zone divine, he cast it far<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into the brackish stream, and a huge wave<br></span>
<span class="i0">Returning bore it downward to the sea,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where Ino caught it. Then, the river’s brink<br></span>
<span class="i0">Abandoning, among the rushes prone<br></span>
<span class="i0">He lay, kiss’d oft the soil, and sighing, said,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ah me! what suff’rings must I now sustain, <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l560" id="BV_l560"></a>560</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">What doom, at last, awaits me? If I watch<br></span>
<span class="i0">This woeful night, here, at the river’s side,<br></span>
<span class="i0">What hope but that the frost and copious dews,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Weak as I am, my remnant small of life<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall quite extinguish, and the chilly air<br></span>
<span class="i0">Breath’d from the river at the dawn of day?<br></span>
<span class="i0">But if, ascending this declivity<br></span>
<span class="i0">I gain the woods, and in some thicket sleep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(If sleep indeed can find me overtoil’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">And cold-benumb’d) then I have cause to fear <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l570" id="BV_l570"></a>570</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Lest I be torn by wild beasts, and devour’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Long time he mused, but, at the last, his course<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bent to the woods, which not remote he saw<br></span>
<span class="i0">From the sea-brink, conspicuous on a hill.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arrived, between two neighbour shrubs he crept,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both olives, this the fruitful, that the wild;<br></span>
<span class="i0">A covert, which nor rough winds blowing moist<br></span>
<span class="i0">Could penetrate, nor could the noon-day sun<br></span>
<span class="i0">Smite through it, or unceasing show’rs pervade,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So thick a roof the ample branches form’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l580" id="BV_l580"></a>580</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Close interwoven; under these the Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Retiring, with industrious hands a bed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Collected broad of leaves, which there he found<br></span>
<span class="i0">Abundant strew’d, such store as had sufficed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Two travellers or three for cov’ring warm,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Though winter’s roughest blasts had rag’d the while.<br></span>
<span class="i0">That bed with joy the suff’ring Chief renown’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Contemplated, and occupying soon<br></span>
<span class="i0">The middle space, hillock’d it high with leaves.<br></span>
<span class="i0">As when some swain hath hidden deep his torch <span class="linenum"><a name="BV_l590" id="BV_l590"></a>590</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the embers, at the verge extreme<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all his farm, where, having neighbours none,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He saves a seed or two of future flame<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alive, doom’d else to fetch it from afar,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So with dry leaves Ulysses overspread<br></span>
<span class="i0">His body, on whose eyes Minerva pour’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The balm of sleep copious, that he might taste<br></span>
<span class="i0">Repose again, after long toil severe.<br></span>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">Minerva designing an interview between the daughter of Alcinoüs and
Ulysses, admonishes her in a dream to carry down her clothes to the
river, that she may wash them, and make them ready for her approaching
nuptials. That task performed, the Princess and her train amuse
themselves with play; by accident they awake Ulysses; he comes forth from
the wood, and applies himself with much address to Nausicaa, who
compassionating his distressed condition, and being much affected by the
dignity of his appearance, interests herself in his favour, and conducts
him to the city.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There then the noble suff’rer lay, by sleep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oppress’d and labour; meantime, Pallas sought<br></span>
<span class="i0">The populous city of Phæacia’s sons.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They, in old time, in Hypereia dwelt<br></span>
<span class="i0">The spacious, neighbours of a giant race<br></span>
<span class="i0">The haughty Cyclops, who, endued with pow’r<br></span>
<span class="i0">Superior, troubled them with frequent wrongs.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Godlike Nausithoüs then arose, who thence<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Scheria led them, from all nations versed<br></span>
<span class="i0">In arts of cultivated life, remote; <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l10" id="BVI_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With bulwarks strong their city he enclosed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Built houses for them, temples to the Gods,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And gave to each a portion of the soil.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But he, already by decree of fate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had journey’d to the shades, and in his stead<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alcinoüs, by the Gods instructed, reign’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">To his abode Minerva azure-eyed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Repair’d, neglecting nought which might advance<br></span>
<span class="i0">Magnanimous Ulysses’ safe return.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She sought the sumptuous chamber where, in form <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l20" id="BVI_l20"></a>20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And feature perfect as the Gods, the young<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nausicaa, daughter of the King, reposed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fast by the pillars of the portal lay<br></span>
<span class="i0">Two damsels, one on either side, adorn’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">By all the Graces, and the doors were shut.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Soft as a breathing air, she stole toward<br></span>
<span class="i0">The royal virgin’s couch, and at her head<br></span>
<span class="i0">Standing, address’d her. Daughter she appear’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Dymas, famed for maritime exploits,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her friend and her coeval; so disguised <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l30" id="BVI_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Cærulean-eyed Minerva thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Nausicaa! wherefore hath thy mother borne<br></span>
<span class="i0">A child so negligent? Thy garments share,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy most magnificent, no thought of thine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet thou must marry soon, and must provide<br></span>
<span class="i0">Robes for thyself, and for thy nuptial train.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy fame, on these concerns, and honour stand;<br></span>
<span class="i0">These managed well, thy parents shall rejoice.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The dawn appearing, let us to the place<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of washing, where thy work-mate I will be <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l40" id="BVI_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For speedier riddance of thy task, since soon<br></span>
<span class="i0">The days of thy virginity shall end;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For thou art woo’d already by the prime<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all Phæacia, country of thy birth.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Come then—solicit at the dawn of day<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy royal father, that he send thee forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">With mules and carriage for conveyance hence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy best robes, thy mantles and thy zones.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, more commodiously thou shalt perform<br></span>
<span class="i0">The journey, for the cisterns lie remote. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l50" id="BVI_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, Minerva, Goddess azure-eyed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rose to Olympus, the reputed seat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eternal of the Gods, which never storms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Disturb, rains drench, or snow invades, but calm<br></span>
<span class="i0">The expanse and cloudless shines with purest day.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There the inhabitants divine rejoice<br></span>
<span class="i0">For ever, (and her admonition giv’n)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cærulean-eyed Minerva thither flew.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Now came Aurora bright-enthroned, whose rays<br></span>
<span class="i0">Awaken’d fair Nausicaa; she her dream <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l60" id="BVI_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Remember’d wond’ring, and her parents sought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Anxious to tell them. Them she found within.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the hearth her royal mother sat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Spinning soft fleeces with sea-purple dyed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Among her menial maidens, but she met<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her father, whom the Nobles of the land<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had summon’d, issuing abroad to join<br></span>
<span class="i0">The illustrious Chiefs in council. At his side<br></span>
<span class="i0">She stood, and thus her filial suit preferr’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Sir!<a name="fnm_23" id="fnm_23"></a><a href="#fn_23" class="fnnum">23</a> wilt thou lend me of the royal wains <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l70" id="BVI_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A sumpter-carriage? for I wish to bear<br></span>
<span class="i0">My costly cloaths but sullied and unfit<br></span>
<span class="i0">For use, at present, to the river side.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It is but seemly that thou should’st repair<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thyself to consultation with the Chiefs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all Phæacia, clad in pure attire;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And my own brothers five, who dwell at home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Two wedded, and the rest of age to wed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Are all desirous, when they dance, to wear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Raiment new bleach’d; all which is my concern. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l80" id="BVI_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake Nausicaa; for she dared not name<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her own glad nuptials to her father’s ear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, conscious yet of all her drift, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">I grudge thee neither mules, my child, nor aught<br></span>
<span class="i0">That thou canst ask beside. Go, and my train<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall furnish thee a sumpter-carriage forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">High-built, strong-wheel’d, and of capacious size.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he issued his command, whom quick<br></span>
<span class="i0">His grooms obey’d. They in the court prepared<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sumpter-carriage, and adjoin’d the mules. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l90" id="BVI_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And now the virgin from her chamber, charged<br></span>
<span class="i0">With raiment, came, which on the car she placed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in the carriage-chest, meantime, the Queen,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her mother, viands of all kinds disposed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And fill’d a skin with wine. Nausicaa rose<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into her seat; but, ere she went, received<br></span>
<span class="i0">A golden cruse of oil from the Queen’s hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">For unction of herself, and of her maids.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, seizing scourge and reins, she lash’d the mules.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They trampled loud the soil, straining to draw <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l100" id="BVI_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Herself with all her vesture; nor alone<br></span>
<span class="i0">She went, but follow’d by her virgin train.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At the delightful rivulet arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where those perennial cisterns were prepared<br></span>
<span class="i0">With purest crystal of the fountain fed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Profuse, sufficient for the deepest stains,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Loosing the mules, they drove them forth to browze<br></span>
<span class="i0">On the sweet herb beside the dimpled flood.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The carriage, next, light’ning, they bore in hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">The garments down to the unsullied wave, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l110" id="BVI_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And thrust them heap’d into the pools, their task<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dispatching brisk, and with an emulous haste.<br></span>
<span class="i0">When they had all purified, and no spot<br></span>
<span class="i0">Could now be seen, or blemish more, they spread<br></span>
<span class="i0">The raiment orderly along the beach<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where dashing tides had cleansed the pebbles most,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And laving, next, and smoothing o’er with oil<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their limbs, all seated on the river’s bank,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They took repast, leaving the garments, stretch’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">In noon-day fervour of the sun, to dry. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l120" id="BVI_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Their hunger satisfied, at once arose<br></span>
<span class="i0">The mistress and her train, and putting off<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their head-attire, play’d wanton with the ball,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The princess singing to her maids the while.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such as shaft-arm’d Diana roams the hills,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Täygetus sky-capt, or Erymanth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The wild boar chasing, or fleet-footed hind,<br></span>
<span class="i0">All joy; the rural nymphs, daughters of Jove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sport with her, and Latona’s heart exults;<br></span>
<span class="i0">She high her graceful head above the rest <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l130" id="BVI_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And features lifts divine, though all be fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With ease distinguishable from them all;<br></span>
<span class="i0">So, all her train, she, virgin pure, surpass’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">But when the hour of her departure thence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Approach’d (the mules now yoked again, and all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her elegant apparel folded neat)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Minerva azure-eyed mused how to wake<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, that he might behold the fair<br></span>
<span class="i0">Virgin, his destin’d guide into the town.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Princess, then, casting the ball toward <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l140" id="BVI_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A maiden of her train, erroneous threw<br></span>
<span class="i0">And plunged it deep into the dimpling stream.<br></span>
<span class="i0">All shrieked; Ulysses at the sound awoke,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, sitting, meditated thus the cause.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ah me! what mortal race inhabit here?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rude are they, contumacious and unjust?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or hospitable, and who fear the Gods?<br></span>
<span class="i0">So shrill the cry and feminine of nymphs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fills all the air around, such as frequent<br></span>
<span class="i0">The hills, clear fountains, and herbaceous meads. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l150" id="BVI_l150"></a>150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Is this a neighbourhood of men endued<br></span>
<span class="i0">With voice articulate? But what avails<br></span>
<span class="i0">To ask; I will myself go forth and see.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, divine Ulysses from beneath<br></span>
<span class="i0">His thicket crept, and from the leafy wood<br></span>
<span class="i0">A spreading branch pluck’d forcibly, design’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">A decent skreen effectual, held before.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So forth he went, as goes the lion forth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The mountain-lion, conscious of his strength,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom winds have vex’d and rains; fire fills his eyes, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l160" id="BVI_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And whether herds or flocks, or woodland deer<br></span>
<span class="i0">He find, he rends them, and, adust for blood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Abstains not even from the guarded fold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such sure to seem in virgin eyes, the Chief,<br></span>
<span class="i0">All naked as he was, left his retreat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reluctant, by necessity constrain’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Him foul with sea foam horror-struck they view’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And o’er the jutting shores fled all dispersed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nausicaa alone fled not; for her<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pallas courageous made, and from her limbs, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l170" id="BVI_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">By pow’r divine, all tremour took away.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Firm she expected him; he doubtful stood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or to implore the lovely maid, her knees<br></span>
<span class="i0">Embracing, or aloof standing, to ask<br></span>
<span class="i0">In gentle terms discrete the gift of cloaths,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And guidance to the city where she dwelt.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Him so deliberating, most, at length,<br></span>
<span class="i0">This counsel pleas’d; in suppliant terms aloof<br></span>
<span class="i0">To sue to her, lest if he clasp’d her knees,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The virgin should that bolder course resent. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l180" id="BVI_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then gentle, thus, and well-advised he spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Oh Queen! thy earnest suppliant I approach.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Art thou some Goddess, or of mortal race?<br></span>
<span class="i0">For if some Goddess, and from heaven arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Diana, then, daughter of mighty Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">I deem thee most, for such as hers appear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy form, thy stature, and thy air divine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But if, of mortal race, thou dwell below,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice happy then, thy parents I account,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And happy thrice thy brethren. Ah! the joy <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l190" id="BVI_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Which always for thy sake, their bosoms fill,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When thee they view, all lovely as thou art,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ent’ring majestic on the graceful dance.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But him beyond all others blest I deem,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The youth, who, wealthier than his rich compeers,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall win and lead thee to his honour’d home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For never with these eyes a mortal form<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld I comparable aught to thine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In man or woman. Wonder-wrapt I gaze.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such erst, in Delos, I beheld a palm <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l200" id="BVI_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the altar of Apollo, tall,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And growing still; (for thither too I sail’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And num’rous were my followers in a voyage<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ordain’d my ruin) and as then I view’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">That palm long time amazed, for never grew<br></span>
<span class="i0">So strait a shaft, so lovely from the ground,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So, Princess! thee with wonder I behold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Charm’d into fixt astonishment, by awe<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alone forbidden to embrace thy knees,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For I am one on whom much woe hath fall’n. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l210" id="BVI_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Yesterday I escaped (the twentieth day<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of my distress by sea) the dreary Deep;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For, all those days, the waves and rapid storms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bore me along, impetuous from the isle<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ogygia; till at length the will of heav’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cast me, that I might also here sustain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Affliction on your shore; for rest, I think,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is not for me. No. The Immortal Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have much to accomplish ere that day arrive.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, oh Queen, pity me! who after long <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l220" id="BVI_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Calamities endured, of all who live<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thee first approach, nor mortal know beside<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the inhabitants of all the land.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shew me your city; give me, although coarse,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some cov’ring (if coarse cov’ring <i>thou</i> canst give)<br></span>
<span class="i0">And may the Gods thy largest wishes grant,<br></span>
<span class="i0">House, husband, concord! for of all the gifts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of heav’n, more precious none I deem, than peace<br></span>
<span class="i0">’Twixt wedded pair, and union undissolved;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Envy torments their enemies, but joy <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l230" id="BVI_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Fills ev’ry virtuous breast, and most their own.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Nausicaa the fair replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Since, stranger! neither base by birth thou seem’st,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor unintelligent, (but Jove, the King<br></span>
<span class="i0">Olympian, gives to good and bad alike<br></span>
<span class="i0">Prosperity according to his will,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And grief to thee, which thou must patient bear,)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now, therefore, at our land and city arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor garment thou shalt want, nor aught beside<br></span>
<span class="i0">Due to a suppliant guest like thee forlorn. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l240" id="BVI_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I will both show thee where our city stands,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And who dwell here. Phæacia’s sons possess<br></span>
<span class="i0">This land; but I am daughter of their King<br></span>
<span class="i0">The brave Alcinoüs, on whose sway depends<br></span>
<span class="i0">For strength and wealth the whole Phæacian race.<br></span>
<span class="i1">She said, and to her beauteous maidens gave<br></span>
<span class="i0">Instant commandment—My attendants, stay!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Why flee ye thus, and whither, from the sight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of a mere mortal? Seems he in your eyes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some enemy of ours? The heart beats not, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l250" id="BVI_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor shall it beat hereafter, which shall come<br></span>
<span class="i0">An enemy to the Phæacian shores,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So dear to the immortal Gods are we.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Remote, amid the billowy Deep, we hold<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our dwelling, utmost of all human-kind,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And free from mixture with a foreign race.<br></span>
<span class="i0">This man, a miserable wand’rer comes,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom we are bound to cherish, for the poor<br></span>
<span class="i0">And stranger are from Jove, and trivial gifts<br></span>
<span class="i0">To such are welcome. Bring ye therefore food <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l260" id="BVI_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And wine, my maidens, for the guest’s regale,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And lave him where the stream is shelter’d most.<br></span>
<span class="i1">She spake; they stood, and by each other’s words<br></span>
<span class="i0">Encouraged, placed Ulysses where the bank<br></span>
<span class="i0">O’erhung the stream, as fair Nausicaa bade,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Daughter of King Alcinoüs the renown’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Apparel also at his side they spread,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mantle and vest, and, next, the limpid oil<br></span>
<span class="i0">Presenting to him in the golden cruse,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exhorted him to bathe in the clear stream. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l270" id="BVI_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses then the maidens thus bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ye maidens, stand apart, that I may cleanse,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself, my shoulders from the briny surf,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And give them oil which they have wanted long.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But in your presence I bathe not, ashamed<br></span>
<span class="i0">To show myself uncloath’d to female eyes.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said; they went, and to Nausicaa told<br></span>
<span class="i0">His answer; then the Hero in the stream<br></span>
<span class="i0">His shoulders laved, and loins incrusted rough<br></span>
<span class="i0">With the salt spray, and with his hands the scum <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l280" id="BVI_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the wild ocean from his locks express’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus wash’d all over, and refresh’d with oil,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He put the garments on, Nausicaa’s gift.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then Pallas, progeny of Jove, his form<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dilated more, and from his head diffused<br></span>
<span class="i0">His curling locks like hyacinthine flowers.<br></span>
<span class="i0">As when some artist, by Minerva made<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Vulcan wise to execute all tasks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ingenious, binding with a golden verge<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bright silver, finishes a graceful work, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l290" id="BVI_l290"></a>290</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Such grace the Goddess o’er his ample chest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Copious diffused, and o’er his manly brows.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Retiring, on the beach he sat, with grace<br></span>
<span class="i0">And dignity illumed, where, viewing him,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The virgin Princess, with amazement mark’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">His beauty, and her damsels thus bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My white-arm’d maidens, listen to my voice!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not hated, sure, by all above, this man<br></span>
<span class="i0">Among Phæacia’s godlike sons arrives.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At first I deem’d him of plebeian sort <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l300" id="BVI_l300"></a>300</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Dishonourable, but he now assumes<br></span>
<span class="i0">A near resemblance to the Gods above.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! would to heaven it were my lot to call<br></span>
<span class="i0">Husband, some native of our land like him<br></span>
<span class="i0">Accomplish’d, and content to inhabit here!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Give him, my maidens, food, and give him wine.<br></span>
<span class="i1">She ended; they obedient to her will,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both wine and food, dispatchful, placed, and glad,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before Ulysses; he rapacious ate,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Toil-suff’ring Chief, and drank, for he had lived <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l310" id="BVI_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">From taste of aliment long time estranged.<br></span>
<span class="i1">On other thoughts meantime intent, her charge<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of folded vestments neat the Princess placed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within the royal wain, then yoked the mules,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to her seat herself ascending, call’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses to depart, and thus she spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Up, stranger! seek the city. I will lead<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy steps toward my royal Father’s house,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where all Phæacia’s Nobles thou shalt see.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But thou (for I account thee not unwise) <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l320" id="BVI_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">This course pursue. While through the fields we pass,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And labours of the rural hind, so long<br></span>
<span class="i0">With my attendants follow fast the mules<br></span>
<span class="i0">And sumpter-carriage. I will be thy guide.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, once the summit gain’d, on which is built<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our city with proud bulwarks fenced around,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And laved on both sides by its pleasant port<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of narrow entrance, where our gallant barks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Line all the road, each station’d in her place,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And where, adjoining close the splendid fane <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l330" id="BVI_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Neptune, stands the forum with huge stones<br></span>
<span class="i0">From quarries thither drawn, constructed strong,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In which the rigging of their barks they keep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sail-cloth and cordage, and make smooth their oars;<br></span>
<span class="i0">(For bow and quiver the Phæacian race<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heed not, but masts and oars, and ships well-poised,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With which exulting they divide the flood)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, cautious, I would shun their bitter taunts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Disgustful, lest they mock me as I pass;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For of the meaner people some are coarse <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l340" id="BVI_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In the extreme, and it may chance that one,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The basest there seeing us shall exclaim—<br></span>
<span class="i0">What handsome stranger of athletic form<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attends the Princess? Where had she the chance<br></span>
<span class="i0">To find him? We shall see them wedded soon.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Either she hath received some vagrant guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">From distant lands, (for no land neighbours ours)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or by her pray’rs incessant won, some God<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath left the heav’ns to be for ever hers.<br></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis well if she have found, by her own search, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l350" id="BVI_l350"></a>350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">An husband for herself, since she accounts<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Nobles of Phæacia, who her hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Solicit num’rous, worthy to be scorn’d—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus will they speak, injurious. I should blame<br></span>
<span class="i0">A virgin guilty of such conduct much,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself, who reckless of her parents’ will,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should so familiar with a man consort,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ere celebration of her spousal rites.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But mark me, stranger! following my advice,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt the sooner at my father’s hands <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l360" id="BVI_l360"></a>360</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Obtain safe conduct and conveyance home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sacred to Pallas a delightful grove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of poplars skirts the road, which we shall reach<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long; within that grove a fountain flows,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And meads encircle it; my father’s farm<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is there, and his luxuriant garden plot;<br></span>
<span class="i0">A shout might reach it from the city-walls.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There wait, till in the town arrived, we gain<br></span>
<span class="i0">My father’s palace, and when reason bids<br></span>
<span class="i0">Suppose us there, then ent’ring thou the town, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l370" id="BVI_l370"></a>370</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ask where Alcinoüs dwells, my valiant Sire.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Well known is his abode, so that with ease<br></span>
<span class="i0">A child might lead thee to it, for in nought<br></span>
<span class="i0">The other houses of our land the house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Resemble, in which dwells the Hero, King<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alcinoüs. Once within the court received<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pause not, but, with swift pace advancing, seek<br></span>
<span class="i0">My mother; she beside a column sits<br></span>
<span class="i0">In the hearth’s blaze, twirling her fleecy threads<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tinged with sea-purple, bright, magnificent! <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l380" id="BVI_l380"></a>380</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With all her maidens orderly behind.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There also stands my father’s throne, on which<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seated, he drinks and banquets like a God.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pass that; then suppliant clasp my mother’s knees,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So shalt thou quickly win a glad return<br></span>
<span class="i0">To thy own home, however far remote.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her favour, once, and her kind aid secured,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thenceforth thou may’st expect thy friends to see,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy dwelling, and thy native soil again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So saying, she with her splendid scourge the mules <span class="linenum"><a name="BVI_l390" id="BVI_l390"></a>390</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Lash’d onward. They (the stream soon left behind)<br></span>
<span class="i0">With even footsteps graceful smote the ground;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But so she ruled them, managing with art<br></span>
<span class="i0">The scourge, as not to leave afar, although<br></span>

<span class="i0">The sun had now declined, when in that grove<br></span>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">Nausicaa returns from the river, whom Ulysses follows. He halts, by her
direction, at a small distance from the palace, which at a convenient
time he enters. He is well received by Alcinoüs and his Queen; and having
related to them the manner of his being cast on the shore of Scheria, and
received from Alcinoüs the promise of safe conduct home, retires to rest.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Such pray’r Ulysses, toil-worn Chief renown’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Pallas made, meantime the virgin, drawn<br></span>
<span class="i0">By her stout mules, Phæacia’s city reach’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, at her father’s house arrived, the car<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stay’d in the vestibule; her brothers five,<br></span>
<span class="i0">All godlike youths, assembling quick around,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Released the mules, and bore the raiment in.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, to her own chamber she return’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where, soon as she arrived, an antient dame<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eurymedusa, by peculiar charge <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l10" id="BVII_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Attendant on that service, kindled fire.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sea-rovers her had from Epirus brought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Long since, and to Alcinoüs she had fall’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">By public gift, for that he ruled, supreme,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Phæacia, and as oft as he harangued<br></span>
<span class="i0">The multitude, was rev’renced as a God.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She waited on the fair Nausicaa, she<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her fuel kindled, and her food prepared.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now Ulysses from his seat arose<br></span>
<span class="i0">To seek the city, around whom, his guard <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l20" id="BVII_l20"></a>20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Benevolent, Minerva, cast a cloud,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lest, haply, some Phæacian should presume<br></span>
<span class="i0">T’ insult the Chief, and question whence he came.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But ere he enter’d yet the pleasant town,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Minerva azure-eyed met him, in form<br></span>
<span class="i0">A blooming maid, bearing her pitcher forth.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She stood before him, and the noble Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, of the Goddess thus enquired.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Daughter! wilt thou direct me to the house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of brave Alcinoüs, whom this land obeys? <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l30" id="BVII_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For I have here arrived, after long toil,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And from a country far remote, a guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">To all who in Phæacia dwell, unknown.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom the Goddess of the azure-eyes.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The mansion of thy search, stranger revered!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself will shew thee; for not distant dwells<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alcinoüs from my father’s own abode:<br></span>
<span class="i0">But hush! be silent—I will lead the way;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mark no man; question no man; for the sight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of strangers is unusual here, and cold <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l40" id="BVII_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The welcome by this people shown to such.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They, trusting in swift ships, by the free grant<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Neptune traverse his wide waters, borne<br></span>
<span class="i0">As if on wings, or with the speed of thought.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake the Goddess, and with nimble pace<br></span>
<span class="i0">Led on, whose footsteps he, as quick, pursued.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But still the seaman-throng through whom he pass’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Perceiv’d him not; Minerva, Goddess dread,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That sight forbidding them, whose eyes she dimm’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With darkness shed miraculous around <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l50" id="BVII_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Her fav’rite Chief. Ulysses, wond’ring, mark’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their port, their ships, their forum, the resort<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Heroes, and their battlements sublime<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fenced with sharp stakes around, a glorious show!<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when the King’s august abode he reach’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Minerva azure-eyed, then, thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My father! thou behold’st the house to which<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou bad’st me lead thee. Thou shalt find our Chiefs<br></span>
<span class="i0">And high-born Princes banqueting within.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But enter fearing nought, for boldest men <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l60" id="BVII_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Speed ever best, come whencesoe’er they may.<br></span>
<span class="i0">First thou shalt find the Queen, known by her name<br></span>
<span class="i0">Areta; lineal in descent from those<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who gave Alcinoüs birth, her royal spouse.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Neptune begat Nausithoüs, at the first,<br></span>
<span class="i0">On Peribæa, loveliest of her sex,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Latest-born daughter of Eurymedon,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heroic King of the proud giant race,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, losing all his impious people, shared<br></span>
<span class="i0">The same dread fate himself. Her Neptune lov’d, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l70" id="BVII_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To whom she bore a son, the mighty prince<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nausithoüs, in his day King of the land.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nausithoüs himself two sons begat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rhexenor and Alcinoüs. Phoebus slew<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rhexenor at his home, a bridegroom yet,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, father of no son, one daughter left,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Areta, wedded to Alcinoüs now,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And whom the Sov’reign in such honour holds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As woman none enjoys of all on earth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Existing, subjects of an husband’s pow’r. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l80" id="BVII_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Like veneration she from all receives<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unfeign’d, from her own children, from himself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alcinoüs, and from all Phæacia’s race,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, gazing on her as she were divine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shout when she moves in progress through the town.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For she no wisdom wants, but sits, herself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arbitress of such contests as arise<br></span>
<span class="i0">Between her fav’rites, and decides aright.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her count’nance once and her kind aid secured,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou may’st thenceforth expect thy friends to see, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l90" id="BVII_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy dwelling, and thy native soil again.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So Pallas spake, Goddess cærulean-eyed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And o’er the untillable and barren Deep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Departing, Scheria left, land of delight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whence reaching Marathon, and Athens next,<br></span>
<span class="i0">She pass’d into Erectheus’ fair abode.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, then, toward the palace moved<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of King Alcinoüs, but immers’d in thought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stood, first, and paused, ere with his foot he press’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The brazen threshold; for a light he saw <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l100" id="BVII_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">As of the sun or moon illuming clear<br></span>

<span class="i0">Walls plated bright with brass, on either side<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stretch’d from the portal to th’ interior house,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With azure cornice crown’d; the doors were gold<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which shut the palace fast; silver the posts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rear’d on a brazen threshold, and above,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The lintels, silver, architraved with gold.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mastiffs, in gold and silver, lined the approach<br></span>
<span class="i0">On either side, by art celestial framed <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l110" id="BVII_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Vulcan, guardians of Alcinoüs’ gate<br></span>
<span class="i0">For ever, unobnoxious to decay.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sheer from the threshold to the inner house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fixt thrones the walls, through all their length, adorn’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With mantles overspread of subtlest warp<br></span>
<span class="i0">Transparent, work of many a female hand.<br></span>
<span class="i0">On these the princes of Phæacia sat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Holding perpetual feasts, while golden youths<br></span>
<span class="i0">On all the sumptuous altars stood, their hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">With burning torches charged, which, night by night, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l120" id="BVII_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Shed radiance over all the festive throng.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Full fifty female menials serv’d the King<br></span>
<span class="i0">In household offices; the rapid mills<br></span>
<span class="i0">These turning, pulverize the mellow’d grain,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Those, seated orderly, the purple fleece<br></span>

<span class="i0">With richest fancy and superior skill.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Without the court, and to the gates adjoin’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">A spacious garden lay, fenced all around<br></span>
<span class="i0">Secure, four acres measuring complete.<br></span>

<span class="i0">The Chiefs he found and Senators within<br></span>

<span class="i0">Of all the Gods, and at the hour of rest.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, toil-worn Hero, through the house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pass’d undelaying, by Minerva thick<br></span>
<span class="i0">With darkness circumfus’d, till he arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where King Alcinoüs and Areta sat.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Around Areta’s knees his arms he cast,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, in that moment, broken clear away<br></span>

<span class="i0">Their treasures to their babes, with all the rights<br></span>
<span class="i0">And honours, by the people’s suffrage, theirs!<br></span>
<span class="i0">But oh vouchsafe me, who have wanted long<br></span>
<span class="i0">And ardent wish’d my home, without delay<br></span>
<span class="i0">Safe conduct to my native shores again! <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l190" id="BVII_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Such suit he made, and in the ashes sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">At the hearth-side; they mute long time remain’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till, at the last, the antient Hero spake<br></span>
<span class="i0">Echeneus, eldest of Phæacia’s sons,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With eloquence beyond the rest endow’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rich in traditionary lore, and wise<br></span>
<span class="i0">In all, who thus, benevolent, began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Not honourable to thyself, O King!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is such a sight, a stranger on the ground<br></span>
<span class="i0">At the hearth-side seated, and in the dust. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l200" id="BVII_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, thy guests, expecting thy command,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Move not; thou therefore raising by his hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">The stranger, lead him to a throne, and bid<br></span>
<span class="i0">The heralds mingle wine, that we may pour<br></span>
<span class="i0">To thunder-bearing Jove, the suppliant’s friend.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then let the cat’ress for thy guest produce<br></span>
<span class="i0">Supply, a supper from the last regale.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Soon as those words Alcinoüs heard, the King,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Upraising by his hand the prudent Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses from the hearth, he made him sit, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l210" id="BVII_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">On a bright throne, displacing for his sake<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laodamas his son, the virtuous youth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who sat beside him, and whom most he lov’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now, a maiden charg’d with golden ew’r<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with an argent laver, pouring, first,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pure water on his hands, supply’d him, next,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With a resplendent table, which the chaste<br></span>
<span class="i0">Directress of the stores furnish’d with bread<br></span>
<span class="i0">And dainties, remnants of the last regale.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then ate the Hero toil-inured, and drank, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l220" id="BVII_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And to his herald thus Alcinoüs spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Pontonoüs! mingling wine, bear it around<br></span>
<span class="i0">To ev’ry guest in turn, that we may pour<br></span>
<span class="i0">To thunder-bearer Jove, the stranger’s friend,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And guardian of the suppliant’s sacred rights.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said; Pontonoüs, as he bade, the wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mingled delicious, and the cups dispensed<br></span>
<span class="i0">With distribution regular to all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">When each had made libation, and had drunk<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sufficient, then, Alcinoüs thus began. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l230" id="BVII_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Phæacian Chiefs and Senators, I speak<br></span>
<span class="i0">The dictates of my mind, therefore attend!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ye all have feasted—To your homes and sleep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">We will assemble at the dawn of day<br></span>
<span class="i0">More senior Chiefs, that we may entertain<br></span>
<span class="i0">The stranger here, and to the Gods perform<br></span>
<span class="i0">Due sacrifice; the convoy that he asks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall next engage our thoughts, that free from pain<br></span>
<span class="i0">And from vexation, by our friendly aid<br></span>
<span class="i0">He may revisit, joyful and with speed, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l240" id="BVII_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His native shore, however far remote.<br></span>
<span class="i0">No inconvenience let him feel or harm,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ere his arrival; but, arrived, thenceforth<br></span>
<span class="i0">He must endure whatever lot the Fates<br></span>
<span class="i0">Spun for him in the moment of his birth.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But should he prove some Deity from heav’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">Descended, then the Immortals have in view<br></span>
<span class="i0">Designs not yet apparent; for the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have ever from of old reveal’d themselves<br></span>
<span class="i0">At our solemnities, have on our seats <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l250" id="BVII_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Sat with us evident, and shared the feast;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And even if a single traveller<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Phæacians meet them, all reserve<br></span>
<span class="i0">They lay aside; for with the Gods we boast<br></span>
<span class="i0">As near affinity as do themselves<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Cyclops, or the Giant race profane.<a name="fnm_26" id="fnm_26"></a><a href="#fn_26" class="fnnum">26</a><br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alcinoüs! think not so. Resemblance none<br></span>
<span class="i0">In figure or in lineaments I bear<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the immortal tenants of the skies, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l260" id="BVII_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But to the sons of earth; if ye have known<br></span>
<span class="i0">A man afflicted with a weight of woe<br></span>
<span class="i0">Peculiar, let me be with him compared;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Woes even passing his could I relate,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And all inflicted on me by the Gods.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But let me eat, comfortless as I am,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Uninterrupted; for no call is loud<br></span>
<span class="i0">As that of hunger in the ears of man;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Importunate, unreas’nable, it constrains<br></span>
<span class="i0">His notice, more than all his woes beside. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l270" id="BVII_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">So, I much sorrow feel, yet not the less<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hear I the blatant appetite demand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Due sustenance, and with a voice that drowns<br></span>
<span class="i0">E’en all my suff’rings, till itself be fill’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But expedite ye at the dawn of day<br></span>
<span class="i0">My safe return into my native land,<br></span>
<span class="i0">After much mis’ry; and let life itself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forsake me, may I but once more behold<br></span>
<span class="i0">All that is mine, in my own lofty abode.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake, whom all applauded, and advised, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l280" id="BVII_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Unanimous, the guest’s conveyance home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who had so fitly spoken. When, at length,<br></span>
<span class="i0">All had libation made, and were sufficed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Departing to his house, each sought repose.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But still Ulysses in the hall remain’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where, godlike King, Alcinoüs at his side<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sat, and Areta; the attendants clear’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the board, and thus the Queen white-arm’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Marking the vest and mantle, which he wore<br></span>
<span class="i0">And which her maidens and herself had made) <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l290" id="BVII_l290"></a>290</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In accents wing’d with eager haste began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Stranger! the first enquiry shall be mine;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who art, and whence? From whom receiv’dst thou these?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Saidst not—I came a wand’rer o’er the Deep?<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh Queen! the task were difficult to unfold<br></span>
<span class="i0">In all its length the story of my woes,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For I have num’rous from the Gods receiv’d;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But I will answer thee as best I may.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There is a certain isle, Ogygia, placed <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l300" id="BVII_l300"></a>300</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Far distant in the Deep; there dwells, by man<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alike unvisited, and by the Gods,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Calypso, beauteous nymph, but deeply skill’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">In artifice, and terrible in pow’r,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Daughter of Atlas. Me alone my fate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her miserable inmate made, when Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had riv’n asunder with his candent bolt<br></span>
<span class="i0">My bark in the mid-sea. There perish’d all<br></span>
<span class="i0">The valiant partners of my toils, and I<br></span>
<span class="i0">My vessel’s keel embracing day and night <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l310" id="BVII_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With folded arms, nine days was borne along.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But on the tenth dark night, as pleas’d the Gods,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They drove me to Ogygia, where resides<br></span>
<span class="i0">Calypso, beauteous nymph, dreadful in pow’r;<br></span>
<span class="i0">She rescued, cherish’d, fed me, and her wish<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was to confer on me immortal life,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exempt for ever from the sap of age.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But me her offer’d boon sway’d not. Sev’n years<br></span>
<span class="i0">I there abode continual, with my tears<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bedewing ceaseless my ambrosial robes, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l320" id="BVII_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Calypso’s gift divine; but when, at length,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Sev’n years elaps’d) the circling eighth arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">She then, herself, my quick departure thence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Advised, by Jove’s own mandate overaw’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which even her had influenced to a change.<br></span>
<span class="i0">On a well-corded raft she sent me forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">With num’rous presents; bread she put and wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">On board, and cloath’d me in immortal robes;<br></span>
<span class="i0">She sent before me also a fair wind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh-blowing, but not dang’rous. Sev’nteen days <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l330" id="BVII_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I sail’d the flood continual, and descried,<br></span>
<span class="i0">On the eighteenth, your shadowy mountains tall<br></span>
<span class="i0">When my exulting heart sprang at the sight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">All wretched as I was, and still ordain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To strive with difficulties many and hard<br></span>
<span class="i0">From adverse Neptune; he the stormy winds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exciting opposite, my wat’ry way<br></span>
<span class="i0">Impeded, and the waves heav’d to a bulk<br></span>
<span class="i0">Immeasurable, such as robb’d me soon<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deep-groaning, of the raft, my only hope; <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l340" id="BVII_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For her the tempest scatter’d, and myself<br></span>
<span class="i0">This ocean measur’d swimming, till the winds<br></span>
<span class="i0">And mighty waters cast me on your shore.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Me there emerging, the huge waves had dash’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Full on the land, where, incommodious most,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The shore presented only roughest rocks,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, leaving it, I swam the Deep again,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till now, at last, a river’s gentle stream<br></span>
<span class="i0">Receiv’d me, by no rocks deform’d, and where<br></span>
<span class="i0">No violent winds the shelter’d bank annoy’d. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l350" id="BVII_l350"></a>350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I flung myself on shore, exhausted, weak,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Needing repose; ambrosial night came on,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When from the Jove-descended stream withdrawn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I in a thicket lay’d me down on leaves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which I had heap’d together, and the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">O’erwhelm’d my eye-lids with a flood of sleep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There under wither’d leaves, forlorn, I slept<br></span>
<span class="i0">All the long night, the morning and the noon,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But balmy sleep, at the decline of day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Broke from me; then, your daughter’s train I heard <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l360" id="BVII_l360"></a>360</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Sporting, with whom she also sported, fair<br></span>
<span class="i0">And graceful as the Gods. To her I kneel’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She, following the dictates of a mind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ingenuous, pass’d in her behaviour all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which even ye could from an age like hers<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have hoped; for youth is ever indiscrete.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She gave me plenteous food, with richest wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Refresh’d my spirit, taught me where to bathe,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And cloath’d me as thou seest; thus, though a prey<br></span>
<span class="i0">To many sorrows, I have told thee truth. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l370" id="BVII_l370"></a>370</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Alcinoüs answer thus return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My daughter’s conduct, I perceive, hath been<br></span>
<span class="i0">In this erroneous, that she led thee not<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hither, at once, with her attendant train,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For thy first suit was to herself alone.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus then Ulysses, wary Chief, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Blame not, O Hero, for so slight a cause<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy faultless child; she bade me follow them,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But I refused, by fear and awe restrain’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lest thou should’st feel displeasure at that sight <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l380" id="BVII_l380"></a>380</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thyself; for we are all, in ev’ry clime,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Suspicious, and to worst constructions prone.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake Ulysses, to whom thus the King.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I bear not, stranger! in my breast an heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">Causeless irascible; for at all times<br></span>
<span class="i0">A temp’rate equanimity is best.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And oh, I would to heav’n, that, being such<br></span>
<span class="i0">As now thou art, and of one mind with me,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou would’st accept my daughter, would’st become<br></span>
<span class="i0">My son-in-law, and dwell contented here! <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l390" id="BVII_l390"></a>390</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">House would I give thee, and possessions too,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Were such thy choice; else, if thou chuse it not,<br></span>
<span class="i0">No man in all Phæacia shall by force<br></span>
<span class="i0">Detain thee. Jupiter himself forbid!<br></span>
<span class="i0">For proof, I will appoint thee convoy hence<br></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow; and while thou by sleep subdued<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shalt on thy bed repose, they with their oars<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall brush the placid flood, till thou arrive<br></span>
<span class="i0">At home, or at what place soe’er thou would’st,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Though far more distant than Eubœa lies, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l400" id="BVII_l400"></a>400</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Remotest isle from us, by the report<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of ours, who saw it when they thither bore<br></span>
<span class="i0">Golden-hair’d Rhadamanthus o’er the Deep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To visit earth-born Tityus. To that isle<br></span>
<span class="i0">They went; they reach’d it, and they brought him thence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Back to Phæacia, in one day, with ease.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou also shalt be taught what ships I boast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unmatch’d in swiftness, and how far my crews<br></span>
<span class="i0">Excel, upturning with their oars the brine.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceas’d; Ulysses toil-inur’d his words <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l410" id="BVII_l410"></a>410</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Exulting heard, and, praying, thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Eternal Father! may the King perform<br></span>
<span class="i0">His whole kind promise! grant him in all lands<br></span>
<span class="i0">A never-dying name, and grant to me<br></span>
<span class="i0">To visit safe my native shores again!<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus they conferr’d; and now Areta bade<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her fair attendants dress a fleecy couch<br></span>
<span class="i0">Under the portico, with purple rugs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Resplendent, and with arras spread beneath,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And over all with cloaks of shaggy pile. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l420" id="BVII_l420"></a>420</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Forth went the maidens, bearing each a torch,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, as she bade, prepared in haste a couch<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of depth commodious, then, returning, gave<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses welcome summons to repose.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Stranger! thy couch is spread. Hence to thy rest.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So they—Thrice grateful to his soul the thought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seem’d of repose. There slept Ulysses, then,<br></span>
<span class="i0">On his carv’d couch, beneath the portico,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But in the inner-house Alcinoüs found<br></span>
<span class="i0">His place of rest, and hers with royal state <span class="linenum"><a name="BVII_l430" id="BVII_l430"></a>430</span><br></span>

Pope has given no translation of this line in the text of his work, but
has translated it in a note. It is variously interpreted by commentators;
the sense which is here given of it is that recommended by Eustathius.</p>

The Scholiast explains the passage thus—We resemble the
Gods in righteousness as much as the Cyclops and Giants resembled each
other in impiety. But in this sense of it there is something intricate
and contrary to Homer’s manner. We have seen that they derived themselves
from Neptune, which sufficiently justifies the above interpretation.</p>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">The Phæacians consult on the subject of Ulysses. Preparation is made for
his departure. Antinoüs entertains them at his table. Games follow the
entertainment. Demodocus the bard sings, first the loves of Mars and
Venus, then the introduction of the wooden horse into Troy. Ulysses, much
affected by his song, is questioned by Alcinoüs, whence, and who he is,
and what is the cause of his sorrow.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Blush’d in the East, then from his bed arose<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sacred might of the Phæacian King.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then uprose also, city-waster Chief,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, whom the King Alcinoüs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Led forth to council at the ships convened.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There, side by side, on polish’d stones they sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Frequent; meantime, Minerva in the form<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of King Alcinoüs’ herald ranged the town,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With purpose to accelerate the return <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l10" id="BVIII_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of brave Ulysses to his native home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thus to ev’ry Chief the Goddess spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Phæacian Chiefs and Senators, away!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Haste all to council on the stranger held,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who hath of late beneath Alcinoüs’ roof<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our King arrived, a wand’rer o’er the Deep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, in his form, majestic as a God.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, she roused the people, and at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">The seats of all the senate-court were fill’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With fast-assembling throngs, no few of whom <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l20" id="BVIII_l20"></a>20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Had mark’d Ulysses with admiring eyes.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, Pallas o’er his head and shoulders broad<br></span>
<span class="i0">Diffusing grace celestial, his whole form<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dilated, and to the statelier height advanced,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That worthier of all rev’rence he might seem<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the Phæacians, and might many a feat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Atchieve, with which they should assay his force.<br></span>
<span class="i1">When, therefore, the assembly now was full,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alcinoüs, them addressing, thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Phæacian Chiefs and Senators! I speak <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l30" id="BVIII_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The dictates of my mind, therefore attend.<br></span>
<span class="i0">This guest, unknown to me, hath, wand’ring, found<br></span>
<span class="i0">My palace, either from the East arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or from some nation on our western side.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Safe conduct home he asks, and our consent<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here wishes ratified, whose quick return<br></span>
<span class="i0">Be it our part, as usual, to promote;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For at no time the stranger, from what coast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Soe’er, who hath resorted to our doors,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath long complain’d of his detention here. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l40" id="BVIII_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Haste—draw ye down into the sacred Deep<br></span>
<span class="i0">A vessel of prime speed, and, from among<br></span>
<span class="i0">The people, fifty and two youths select,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Approved the best; then, lashing fast the oars,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Leave her, that at my palace ye may make<br></span>
<span class="i0">Short feast, for which myself will all provide.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus I enjoin the crew; but as for those<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of sceptred rank, I bid them all alike<br></span>
<span class="i0">To my own board, that here we may regale<br></span>
<span class="i0">The stranger nobly, and let none refuse. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l50" id="BVIII_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Call, too, Demodocus, the bard divine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To share my banquet, whom the Gods have blest<br></span>
<span class="i0">With pow’rs of song delectable, unmatch’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">By any, when his genius once is fired.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceas’d, and led the way, whom follow’d all<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sceptred senators, while to the house<br></span>
<span class="i0">An herald hasted of the bard divine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, fifty mariners and two, from all<br></span>
<span class="i0">The rest selected, to the coast repair’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, from her station on the sea-bank, launched <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l60" id="BVIII_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The galley down into the sacred Deep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They placed the canvas and the mast on board,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arranged the oars, unfurl’d the shining sail,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, leaving her in depth of water moor’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">All sought the palace of Alcinoüs.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There, soon, the portico, the court, the hall<br></span>
<span class="i0">Were fill’d with multitudes of young and old,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For whose regale the mighty monarch slew<br></span>
<span class="i0">Two beeves, twelve sheep, and twice four fatted brawns.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They slay’d them first, then busily their task <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l70" id="BVIII_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Administ’ring, prepared the joyous feast.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now the herald came, leading with care<br></span>
<span class="i0">The tuneful bard; dear to the muse was he,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who yet appointed him both good and ill;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Took from him sight, but gave him strains divine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For him, Pontonoüs in the midst disposed<br></span>
<span class="i0">An argent-studded throne, thrusting it close<br></span>
<span class="i0">To a tall column, where he hung his lyre<br></span>
<span class="i0">Above his head, and taught him where it hung.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He set before him, next, a polish’d board <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l80" id="BVIII_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And basket, and a goblet fill’d with wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">For his own use, and at his own command.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, all assail’d at once the ready feast,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And when nor hunger more nor thirst they felt,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then came the muse, and roused the bard to sing<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exploits of men renown’d; it was a song,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In that day, to the highest heav’n extoll’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He sang of a dispute kindled between<br></span>
<span class="i0">The son of Peleus, and Laertes’<a name="fnm_27" id="fnm_27"></a><a href="#fn_27" class="fnnum">27</a> son,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both seated at a feast held to the Gods. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l90" id="BVIII_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That contest Agamemnon, King of men,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Between the noblest of Achaia’s host<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hearing, rejoiced; for when in Pytho erst<br></span>
<span class="i0">He pass’d the marble threshold to consult<br></span>
<span class="i0">The oracle of Apollo, such dispute<br></span>
<span class="i0">The voice divine had to his ear announced;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For then it was that, first, the storm of war<br></span>
<span class="i0">Came rolling on, ordain’d long time to afflict<br></span>
<span class="i0">Troy and the Greecians, by the will of Jove.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So sang the bard illustrious; then his robe <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l100" id="BVIII_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of purple dye with both hands o’er his head<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses drew, behind its ample folds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Veiling his face, through fear to be observed<br></span>
<span class="i0">By the Phæacians weeping at the song;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And ever as the bard harmonious ceased,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He wiped his tears, and, drawing from his brows<br></span>
<span class="i0">The mantle, pour’d libation to the Gods.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when the Chiefs (for they delighted heard<br></span>
<span class="i0">Those sounds) solicited again the bard,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he renew’d the strain, then cov’ring close <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l110" id="BVIII_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His count’nance, as before, Ulysses wept.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, unperceiv’d by all, the Hero mourn’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Save by Alcinoüs; he alone his tears,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Beside him seated) mark’d, and his deep sighs<br></span>
<span class="i0">O’erhearing, the Phæacians thus bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Phæacia’s Chiefs and Senators, attend!<br></span>
<span class="i0">We have regaled sufficient, and the harp<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heard to satiety, companion sweet<br></span>
<span class="i0">And seasonable of the festive hour.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now go we forth for honourable proof <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l120" id="BVIII_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of our address in games of ev’ry kind,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That this our guest may to his friends report,<br></span>
<span class="i0">At home arriv’d, that none like us have learn’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To leap, to box, to wrestle, and to run.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he led them forth, whose steps the guests<br></span>
<span class="i0">All follow’d, and the herald hanging high<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sprightly lyre, took by his hand the bard<br></span>
<span class="i0">Demodocus, whom he the self-same way<br></span>
<span class="i0">Conducted forth, by which the Chiefs had gone<br></span>
<span class="i0">Themselves, for that great spectacle prepared. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l130" id="BVIII_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">They sought the forum; countless swarm’d the throng<br></span>
<span class="i0">Behind them as they went, and many a youth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Strong and courageous to the strife arose.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Upstood Acroneus and Ocyalus,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Elatreus, Nauteus, Prymneus, after whom<br></span>
<span class="i0">Anchialus with Anabeesineus<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arose, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus bold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amphialus and Thöon. Then arose,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In aspect dread as homicidal Mars,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Euryalus, and for his graceful form <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l140" id="BVIII_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">(After Laodamas) distinguish’d most<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all Phæacia’s sons, Naubolides.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Three also from Alcinoüs sprung, arose,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laodamas, his eldest; Halius, next,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His second-born; and godlike Clytoneus.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of these, some started for the runner’s prize.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They gave the race its limits.<a name="fnm_28" id="fnm_28"></a><a href="#fn_28" class="fnnum">28</a> All at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">Along the dusty champaign swift they flew.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But Clytoneus, illustrious youth, outstripp’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">All competition; far as mules surpass <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l150" id="BVIII_l150"></a>150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Slow oxen furrowing the fallow ground,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So far before all others he arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">Victorious, where the throng’d spectators stood.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some tried the wrestler’s toil severe, in which<br></span>
<span class="i0">Euryalus superior proved to all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">In the long leap Amphialus prevail’d;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Elatreus most successful hurled the quoit,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And at the cestus,<a name="fnm_29" id="fnm_29"></a><a href="#fn_29" class="fnnum">29</a> last, the noble son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Scheria’s King, Laodamas excell’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">When thus with contemplation of the games <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l160" id="BVIII_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">All had been gratified, Alcinoüs’ son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laodamas, arising, then address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Friends! ask we now the stranger, if he boast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Proficiency in aught. His figure seems<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not ill; in thighs, and legs, and arms he shews<br></span>
<span class="i0">Much strength, and in his brawny neck; nor youth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath left him yet, though batter’d he appears<br></span>
<span class="i0">With num’rous troubles, and misfortune-flaw’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor know I hardships in the world so sure<br></span>
<span class="i0">To break the strongest down, as those by sea. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l170" id="BVIII_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer thus Euryalus return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast well said, Laodamas; thyself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Approaching, speak to him, and call him forth.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Which when Alcinoüs’ noble offspring heard,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Advancing from his seat, amid them all<br></span>
<span class="i0">He stood, and to Ulysses thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Stand forth, oh guest, thou also; prove thy skill<br></span>
<span class="i0">(If any such thou hast) in games like ours,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which, likeliest, thou hast learn’d; for greater praise<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath no man, while he lives, than that he know <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l180" id="BVIII_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His feet to exercise and hands aright.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Come then; make trial; scatter wide thy cares,<br></span>
<span class="i0">We will not hold thee long; the ship is launch’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Already, and the crew stand all prepared.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom replied the wily Chief renown’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore, as in derision, have ye call’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Me forth, Laodamas, to these exploits?<br></span>
<span class="i0">No games have I, but many a grief, at heart,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with far other struggles worn, here sit<br></span>
<span class="i0">Desirous only of conveyance home, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l190" id="BVIII_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For which both King and people I implore.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then him Euryalus aloud reproach’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I well believ’d it, friend! in thee the guise<br></span>
<span class="i0">I see not of a man expert in feats<br></span>
<span class="i0">Athletic, of which various are perform’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">In ev’ry land; thou rather seem’st with ships<br></span>
<span class="i0">Familiar; one, accustom’d to controul<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some crew of trading mariners; well-learn’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">In stowage, pilotage, and wealth acquired<br></span>
<span class="i0">By rapine, but of no gymnastic pow’rs. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l200" id="BVIII_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, frowning dark, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast ill spoken, sir, and like a man<br></span>
<span class="i0">Regardless whom he wrongs. Therefore the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Give not endowments graceful in each kind,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of body, mind, and utt’rance, all to one.<br></span>
<span class="i0">This man in figure less excels, yet Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Crowns him with eloquence; his hearers charm’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Behold him, while with modest confidence<br></span>
<span class="i0">He bears the prize of fluent speech from all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in the streets is gazed on as a God! <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l210" id="BVIII_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Another, in his form the Pow’rs above<br></span>
<span class="i0">Resembles, but no grace around his words<br></span>
<span class="i0">Twines itself elegant. So, thou in form<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hast excellence to boast; a God, employ’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To make a master-piece in human shape,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Could but produce proportions such as thine;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet hast thou an untutor’d intellect.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou much hast moved me; thy unhandsome phrase<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath roused my wrath; I am not, as thou say’st,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A novice in these sports, but took the lead <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l220" id="BVIII_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In all, while youth and strength were on my side.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But I am now in bands of sorrow held,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And of misfortune, having much endured<br></span>
<span class="i0">In war, and buffeting the boist’rous waves.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, though with mis’ry worn, I will essay<br></span>
<span class="i0">My strength among you; for thy words had teeth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose bite hath pinch’d and pain’d me to the proof.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said; and mantled as he was, a quoit<br></span>
<span class="i0">Upstarting, seized, in bulk and weight all those<br></span>
<span class="i0">Transcending far, by the Phæacians used. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l230" id="BVIII_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Swiftly he swung, and from his vig’rous hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sent it. Loud sang the stone, and as it flew<br></span>
<span class="i0">The maritime Phæacians low inclined<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their heads beneath it; over all the marks,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And far beyond them, sped the flying rock.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Minerva, in a human form, the cast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Prodigious measur’d, and aloud exclaim’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Stranger! the blind himself might with his hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">Feel out the ’vantage here. Thy quoit disdains<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fellowship with a crowd, borne far beyond. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l240" id="BVIII_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Fear not a losing game; Phæacian none<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will reach thy measure, much less overcast.<br></span>
<span class="i1">She ceased; Ulysses, hardy Chief, rejoiced<br></span>
<span class="i0">That in the circus he had found a judge<br></span>
<span class="i0">So favorable, and with brisker tone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As less in wrath, the multitude address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Young men, reach this, and I will quickly heave<br></span>
<span class="i0">Another such, or yet a heavier quoit.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, come the man whose courage prompts him forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">To box, to wrestle with me, or to run; <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l250" id="BVIII_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For ye have chafed me much, and I decline<br></span>
<span class="i0">No strife with any here, but challenge all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Phæacia, save Laodamas alone.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He is mine host. Who combats with his friend?<br></span>
<span class="i0">To call to proof of hardiment the man<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who entertains him in a foreign land,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Would but evince the challenger a fool,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, so, would cripple his own interest there.<br></span>
<span class="i0">As for the rest, I none refuse, scorn none,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But wish for trial of you, and to match <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l260" id="BVIII_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In opposition fair my force with yours.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There is no game athletic in the use<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all mankind, too difficult for me;<br></span>
<span class="i0">I handle well the polish’d bow, and first<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amid a thousand foes strike whom I mark,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Although a throng of warriors at my side<br></span>
<span class="i0">Imbattled, speed their shafts at the same time.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all Achaia’s sons who erst at Troy<br></span>
<span class="i0">Drew bow, the sole who bore the prize from me<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was Philoctetes; I resign it else <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l270" id="BVIII_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To none now nourish’d with the fruits of earth.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet mean I no comparison of myself<br></span>
<span class="i0">With men of antient times, with Hercules,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or with Oechalian Eurytus, who, both,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Gods themselves in archery defied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Soon, therefore, died huge Eurytus, ere yet<br></span>
<span class="i0">Old age he reach’d; him, angry to be call’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To proof of archership, Apollo slew.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But if ye name the spear, mine flies a length<br></span>
<span class="i0">By no man’s arrow reach’d; I fear no foil <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l280" id="BVIII_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">From the Phæacians, save in speed alone;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For I have suffer’d hardships, dash’d and drench’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">By many a wave, nor had I food on board<br></span>
<span class="i0">At all times, therefore I am much unstrung.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake; and silent the Phæacians sat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of whom alone Alcinoüs thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Since, stranger, not ungraceful is thy speech,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who hast but vindicated in our ears<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy question’d prowess, angry that this youth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reproach’d thee in the presence of us all, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l290" id="BVIII_l290"></a>290</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That no man qualified to give his voice<br></span>
<span class="i0">In public, might affront thy courage more;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now mark me, therefore, that in time to come,<br></span>
<span class="i0">While feasting with thy children and thy spouse,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou may’st inform the Heroes of thy land<br></span>
<span class="i0">Even of our proficiency in arts<br></span>
<span class="i0">By Jove enjoin’d us in our father’s days.<br></span>
<span class="i0">We boast not much the boxer’s skill, nor yet<br></span>
<span class="i0">The wrestler’s; but light-footed in the race<br></span>
<span class="i0">Are we, and navigators well-inform’d. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l300" id="BVIII_l300"></a>300</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Our pleasures are the feast, the harp, the dance,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Garments for change; the tepid bath; the bed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Come, ye Phæacians, beyond others skill’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To tread the circus with harmonious steps,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Come, play before us; that our guest, arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">In his own country, may inform his friends<br></span>
<span class="i0">How far in seamanship we all excel,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In running, in the dance, and in the song.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Haste! bring ye to Demodocus his lyre<br></span>
<span class="i0">Clear-toned, left somewhere in our hall at home. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l310" id="BVIII_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake the godlike King, at whose command<br></span>
<span class="i0">The herald to the palace quick return’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To seek the charming lyre. Meantime arose<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nine arbiters, appointed to intend<br></span>
<span class="i0">The whole arrangement of the public games,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To smooth the circus floor, and give the ring<br></span>
<span class="i0">Its compass, widening the attentive throng.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long the herald came, bearing the harp,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With which Demodocus supplied, advanced<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into the middle area, around whom <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l320" id="BVIII_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Stood blooming youths, all skilful in the dance.<br></span>
<span class="i0">With footsteps justly timed all smote at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sacred floor; Ulysses wonder-fixt,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The ceaseless play of twinkling<a name="fnm_30" id="fnm_30"></a><a href="#fn_30" class="fnnum">30</a> feet admired.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then, tuning his sweet chords, Demodocus<br></span>
<span class="i0">A jocund strain began, his theme, the loves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Mars and Cytherea chaplet-crown’d;<br></span>
<span class="i0">How first, clandestine, they embraced beneath<br></span>
<span class="i0">The roof of Vulcan, her, by many a gift<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seduced, Mars won, and with adult’rous lust <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l330" id="BVIII_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The bed dishonour’d of the King of fire.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sun, a witness of their amorous sport,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bore swift the tale to Vulcan; he, apprized<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of that foul deed, at once his smithy sought,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In secret darkness of his inmost soul<br></span>
<span class="i0">Contriving vengeance; to the stock he heav’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">His anvil huge, on which he forged a snare<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of bands indissoluble, by no art<br></span>
<span class="i0">To be untied, durance for ever firm.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The net prepared, he bore it, fiery-wroth, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l340" id="BVIII_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To his own chamber and his nuptial couch,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where, stretching them from post to post, he wrapp’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With those fine meshes all his bed around,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And hung them num’rous from the roof, diffused<br></span>
<span class="i0">Like spiders’ filaments, which not the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Themselves could see, so subtle were the toils.<br></span>
<span class="i0">When thus he had encircled all his bed<br></span>
<span class="i0">On ev’ry side, he feign’d a journey thence<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Lemnos, of all cities that adorn<br></span>
<span class="i0">The earth, the city that he favours most. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l350" id="BVIII_l350"></a>350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor kept the God of the resplendent reins<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mars, drowsy watch, but seeing that the famed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Artificer of heav’n had left his home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Flew to the house of Vulcan, hot to enjoy<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Goddess with the wreath-encircled brows.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She, newly from her potent Sire return’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The son of Saturn, sat. Mars, ent’ring, seiz’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her hand, hung on it, and thus urg’d his suit.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To bed, my fair, and let us love! for lo!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thine husband is from home, to Lemnos gone, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l360" id="BVIII_l360"></a>360</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And to the Sintians, men of barb’rous speech.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake, nor she was loth, but bedward too<br></span>
<span class="i0">Like him inclined; so then, to bed they went,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And as they lay’d them down, down stream’d the net<br></span>
<span class="i0">Around them, labour exquisite of hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">By ingenuity divine inform’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Small room they found, so prison’d; not a limb<br></span>
<span class="i0">Could either lift, or move, but felt at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">Entanglement from which was no escape.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now the glorious artist, ere he yet <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l370" id="BVIII_l370"></a>370</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Had reach’d the Lemnian isle, limping, return’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">From his feign’d journey, for his spy the sun<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had told him all. With aching heart he sought<br></span>
<span class="i0">His home, and, standing in the vestibule,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Frantic with indignation roar’d to heav’n,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And roar’d again, summoning all the Gods.—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh Jove! and all ye Pow’rs for ever blest!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here; hither look, that ye may view a sight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ludicrous, yet too monstrous to be borne,<br></span>
<span class="i0">How Venus always with dishonour loads <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l380" id="BVIII_l380"></a>380</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Her cripple spouse, doating on fiery Mars!<br></span>
<span class="i0">And wherefore? for that he is fair in form<br></span>
<span class="i0">And sound of foot, I ricket-boned and weak.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose fault is this? Their fault, and theirs alone<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who gave me being; ill-employ’d were they<br></span>
<span class="i0">Begetting me, one, better far unborn.<br></span>
<span class="i0">See where they couch together on my bed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lascivious! ah, sight hateful to my eyes!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet cooler wishes will they feel, I ween,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To press my bed hereafter; here to sleep <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l390" id="BVIII_l390"></a>390</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Will little please them, fondly as they love.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But these my toils and tangles will suffice<br></span>
<span class="i0">To hold them here, till Jove shall yield me back<br></span>
<span class="i0">Complete, the sum of all my nuptial gifts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Paid to him for the shameless strumpet’s sake<br></span>
<span class="i0">His daughter, as incontinent as fair.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and in the brazen-floor’d abode<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Jove the Gods assembled. Neptune came<br></span>
<span class="i0">Earth-circling Pow’r; came Hermes friend of man,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, regent of the far-commanding bow, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l400" id="BVIII_l400"></a>400</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Apollo also came; but chaste reserve<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bashful kept all the Goddesses at home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Gods, by whose beneficence all live,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stood in the portal; infinite arose<br></span>
<span class="i0">The laugh of heav’n, all looking down intent<br></span>
<span class="i0">On that shrewd project of the smith divine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, turning to each other, thus they said.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Bad works speed ill. The slow o’ertakes the swift.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So Vulcan, tardy as he is, by craft<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath outstript Mars, although the fleetest far <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l410" id="BVIII_l410"></a>410</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all who dwell in heav’n, and the light-heel’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Must pay the adult’rer’s forfeit to the lame.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake the Pow’rs immortal; then the King<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of radiant shafts thus question’d Mercury.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Jove’s son, heaven’s herald, Hermes, bounteous God!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Would’st <i>thou</i> such stricture close of bands endure<br></span>
<span class="i0">For golden Venus lying at thy side?<br></span>
<span class="i1">Whom answer’d thus the messenger of heav’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">Archer divine! yea, and with all my heart;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And be the bands which wind us round about <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l420" id="BVIII_l420"></a>420</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice these innumerable, and let all<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Gods and Goddesses in heav’n look on,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So I may clasp Vulcan’s fair spouse the while.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake; then laugh’d the Immortal Pow’rs again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But not so Neptune; he with earnest suit<br></span>
<span class="i0">The glorious artist urged to the release<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Mars, and thus in accents wing’d he said.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Loose him; accept my promise; he shall pay<br></span>
<span class="i0">Full recompense in presence of us all.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then thus the limping smith far-famed replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l430" id="BVIII_l430"></a>430</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Earth-circler Neptune, spare me that request.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lame suitor, lame security.<a name="fnm_31" id="fnm_31"></a><a href="#fn_31" class="fnnum">31</a> What bands<br></span>
<span class="i0">Could I devise for thee among the Gods,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should Mars, emancipated once, escape,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving both debt and durance, far behind?<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d then the Shaker of the shores.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I tell thee, Vulcan, that if Mars by flight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shun payment, I will pay, myself, the fine.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom the glorious artist of the skies.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou must not, canst not, shalt not be refused. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l440" id="BVIII_l440"></a>440</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, the might of Vulcan loos’d the snare,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And they, detain’d by those coercive bands<br></span>
<span class="i0">No longer, from the couch upstarting, flew,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mars into Thrace, and to her Paphian home<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Queen of smiles, where deep in myrtle groves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her incense-breathing altar stands embow’r’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her there, the Graces laved, and oils diffused<br></span>
<span class="i0">O’er all her form, ambrosial, such as add<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh beauty to the Gods for ever young,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And cloath’d her in the loveliest robes of heav’n. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l450" id="BVIII_l450"></a>450</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Such was the theme of the illustrious bard.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses with delight that song, and all<br></span>
<span class="i0">The maritime Phæacian concourse heard.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Alcinoüs, then, (for in the dance they pass’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">All others) call’d his sons to dance alone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Halius and Laodamas; they gave<br></span>
<span class="i0">The purple ball into their hands, the work<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exact of Polybus; one, re-supine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Upcast it high toward the dusky clouds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The other, springing into air, with ease <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l460" id="BVIII_l460"></a>460</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Received it, ere he sank to earth again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">When thus they oft had sported with the ball<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thrown upward, next, with nimble interchange<br></span>
<span class="i0">They pass’d it to each other many a time,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Footing the plain, while ev’ry youth of all<br></span>
<span class="i0">The circus clapp’d his hands, and from beneath<br></span>
<span class="i0">The din of stamping feet fill’d all the air.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then, turning to Alcinoüs, thus the wise<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses spake: Alcinoüs! mighty King!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Illustrious above all Phæacia’s sons! <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l470" id="BVIII_l470"></a>470</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Incomparable are ye in the dance,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ev’n as thou said’st. Amazement-fixt I stand!<br></span>
<span class="i1">So he, whom hearing, the imperial might<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exulted of Alcinoüs, and aloud<br></span>
<span class="i0">To his oar-skill’d Phæacians thus he spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Phæacian Chiefs and Senators, attend!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wisdom beyond the common stint I mark<br></span>
<span class="i0">In this our guest; good cause in my account,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For which we should present him with a pledge<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of hospitality and love. The Chiefs <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l480" id="BVIII_l480"></a>480</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Are twelve, who, highest in command, controul<br></span>
<span class="i0">The people, and the thirteenth Chief am I.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bring each a golden talent, with a vest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Well-bleach’d, and tunic; gratified with these,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The stranger to our banquet shall repair<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exulting; bring them all without delay;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And let Euryalus by word and gift<br></span>
<span class="i0">Appease him, for his speech was unadvised.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceas’d, whom all applauded, and at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">Each sent his herald forth to bring the gifts, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l490" id="BVIII_l490"></a>490</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">When thus Euryalus his Sire address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Alcinoüs! o’er Phæacia’s sons supreme!<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will appease our guest, as thou command’st.<br></span>
<span class="i0">This sword shall be his own, the blade all steel.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The hilt of silver, and the unsullied sheath<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of iv’ry recent from the carver’s hand,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A gift like this he shall not need despise.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, his silver-studded sword he gave<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into his grasp, and, courteous, thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Hail, honour’d stranger! and if word of mine <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l500" id="BVIII_l500"></a>500</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Have harm’d thee, rashly spoken, let the winds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bear all remembrance of it swift away!<br></span>
<span class="i0">May the Gods give thee to behold again<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy wife, and to attain thy native shore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whence absent long, thou hast so much endured!<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hail also thou, and may the Gods, my friend,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grant thee felicity, and may never want<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of this thy sword touch thee in time to come,<br></span>
<span class="i0">By whose kind phrase appeas’d my wrath subsides! <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l510" id="BVIII_l510"></a>510</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, and athwart his shoulders threw<br></span>
<span class="i0">The weapon bright emboss’d. Now sank the sun,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And those rich gifts arrived, which to the house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of King Alcinoüs the heralds bore.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alcinoüs’ sons receiv’d them, and beside<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their royal mother placed the precious charge.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The King then led the way, at whose abode<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arrived, again they press’d their lofty thrones,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to Areta thus the monarch spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Haste, bring a coffer; bring thy best, and store <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l520" id="BVIII_l520"></a>520</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A mantle and a sumptuous vest within;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Warm for him, next, a brazen bath, by which<br></span>
<span class="i0">Refresh’d, and viewing in fair order placed<br></span>
<span class="i0">The noble gifts by the Phæacian Lords<br></span>
<span class="i0">Conferr’d on him, he may the more enjoy<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our banquet, and the bard’s harmonious song.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I give him also this my golden cup<br></span>
<span class="i0">Splendid, elaborate; that, while he lives<br></span>
<span class="i0">What time he pours libation forth to Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">And all the Gods, he may remember me. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l530" id="BVIII_l530"></a>530</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, at whose words Areta bade<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her maidens with dispatch place o’er the fire<br></span>
<span class="i0">A tripod ample-womb’d; obedient they<br></span>
<span class="i0">Advanced a laver to the glowing hearth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Water infused, and kindled wood beneath<br></span>
<span class="i0">The flames encircling bright the bellied vase,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Warm’d soon the flood within. Meantime, the Queen<br></span>
<span class="i0">Producing from her chamber-stores a chest<br></span>
<span class="i0">All-elegant, within it placed the gold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And raiment, gifts of the Phæacian Chiefs, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l540" id="BVIII_l540"></a>540</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With her own gifts, the mantle and the vest,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in wing’d accents to Ulysses said.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Now take, thyself, the coffer’s lid in charge;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Girdle it quickly with a cord, lest loss<br></span>
<span class="i0">Befall thee on thy way, while thou perchance<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shalt sleep secure on board the sable bark.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Which when Ulysses heard, Hero renown’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Adjusting close the lid, he cast a cord<br></span>
<span class="i0">Around it which with many a mazy knot<br></span>
<span class="i0">He tied, by Circe taught him long before. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l550" id="BVIII_l550"></a>550</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And now, the mistress of the household charge<br></span>
<span class="i0">Summon’d him to his bath; glad he beheld<br></span>
<span class="i0">The steaming vase, uncustom’d to its use<br></span>
<span class="i0">E’er since his voyage from the isle of fair<br></span>
<span class="i0">Calypso, although, while a guest with her,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ever familiar with it, as a God.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laved by attendant damsels, and with oil<br></span>
<span class="i0">Refresh’d, he put his sumptuous tunic on<br></span>
<span class="i0">And mantle, and proceeding from the bath<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the symposium, join’d the num’rous guests; <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l560" id="BVIII_l560"></a>560</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But, as he pass’d, the Princess all divine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the pillars of the portal, lost<br></span>
<span class="i0">In admiration of his graceful form,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stood, and in accents wing’d him thus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Hail, stranger! at thy native home arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">Remember me, thy first deliv’rer here.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nausicaa! daughter of the noble King<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alcinoüs! So may Jove, high-thund’ring mate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Juno, grant me to behold again <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l570" id="BVIII_l570"></a>570</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">My native land, and my delightful home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As, even there, I will present my vows<br></span>
<span class="i0">To thee, adoring thee as I adore<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Gods themselves, virgin, by whom I live!<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and on his throne beside the King<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alcinoüs sat. And now they portion’d out<br></span>
<span class="i0">The feast to all, and charg’d the cups with wine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And introducing by his hand the bard<br></span>
<span class="i0">Phæacia’s glory, at the column’s side<br></span>
<span class="i0">The herald placed Demodocus again. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l580" id="BVIII_l580"></a>580</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Then, carving forth a portion from the loins<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of a huge brawn, of which uneaten still<br></span>
<span class="i0">Large part and delicate remain’d, thus spake<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses—Herald! bear it to the bard<br></span>
<span class="i0">For his regale, whom I will soon embrace<br></span>
<span class="i0">In spite of sorrow; for respect is due<br></span>
<span class="i0">And veneration to the sacred bard<br></span>
<span class="i0">From all mankind, for that the muse inspires<br></span>
<span class="i0">Herself his song, and loves the tuneful tribe.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, and the herald bore his charge <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l590" id="BVIII_l590"></a>590</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To the old hero who with joy received<br></span>
<span class="i0">That meed of honour at the bearer’s hand.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, all, at once, assail’d the ready feast,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And hunger now, and thirst both satisfied,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus to Demodocus Ulysses spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Demodocus! I give thee praise above<br></span>
<span class="i0">All mortals, for that either thee the muse<br></span>
<span class="i0">Jove’s daughter teaches, or the King, himself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Apollo; since thou so record’st the fate,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With such clear method, of Achaia’s host, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l600" id="BVIII_l600"></a>600</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Their deeds heroic, and their num’rous toils,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As thou hadst present been thyself, or learnt<br></span>
<span class="i0">From others present there, the glorious tale.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Come, then, proceed; that rare invention sing,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The horse of wood, which by Minerva’s aid<br></span>
<span class="i0">Epeus framed, and which Ulysses erst<br></span>
<span class="i0">Convey’d into the citadel of Troy<br></span>
<span class="i0">With warriors fill’d, who lay’d all Ilium waste.<br></span>
<span class="i0">These things rehearse regular, and myself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will, instant, publish in the ears of all <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l610" id="BVIII_l610"></a>610</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy fame, reporting thee a bard to whom<br></span>
<span class="i0">Apollo free imparts celestial song.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended; then Apollo with full force<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rush’d on Demodocus, and he began<br></span>
<span class="i0">What time the Greeks, first firing their own camp<br></span>
<span class="i0">Steer’d all their galleys from the shore of Troy.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Already, in the horse conceal’d, his band<br></span>
<span class="i0">Around Ulysses sat; for Ilium’s sons<br></span>
<span class="i0">Themselves had drawn it to the citadel.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And there the mischief stood. Then, strife arose <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l620" id="BVIII_l620"></a>620</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Among the Trojans compassing the horse,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And threefold was the doubt; whether to cleave<br></span>
<span class="i0">The hollow trunk asunder, or updrawn<br></span>
<span class="i0">Aloft, to cast it headlong from the rocks,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or to permit the enormous image, kept<br></span>
<span class="i0">Entire, to stand an off’ring to the Gods,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which was their destined course; for Fate had fix’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their ruin sure, when once they had received<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within their walls that engine huge, in which<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sat all the bravest Greecians with the fate <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l630" id="BVIII_l630"></a>630</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ilium charged, and slaughter of her sons.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He sang, how, from the horse effused, the Greeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Left their capacious ambush, and the town<br></span>
<span class="i0">Made desolate. To others, in his song,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He gave the praise of wasting all beside,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But told how, fierce as Mars, Ulysses join’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With godlike Menelaus, to the house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Flew of Deiphobus; him there engaged<br></span>
<span class="i0">In direst fight he sang, and through the aid<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of glorious Pallas, conqu’ror over all. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l640" id="BVIII_l640"></a>640</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">So sang the bard illustrious, at whose song<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses melted, and tear after tear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fell on his cheeks. As when a woman weeps,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her husband, who hath fallen in defence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of his own city and his babes before<br></span>
<span class="i0">The gates; she, sinking, folds him in her arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, gazing on him as he pants and dies,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shrieks at the sight; meantime, the enemy<br></span>
<span class="i0">Smiting her shoulders with the spear to toil<br></span>
<span class="i0">Command her and to bondage far away, <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l650" id="BVIII_l650"></a>650</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And her cheek fades with horror at the sound;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, so, from his moist lids let fall,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The frequent tear. Unnoticed by the rest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Those drops, but not by King Alcinoüs, fell<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, seated at his side, his heavy sighs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Remark’d, and the Phæacians thus bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Phæacian Chiefs and Senators attend!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now let Demodocus enjoin his harp<br></span>
<span class="i0">Silence, for not alike grateful to all<br></span>
<span class="i0">His music sounds; during our feast, and since <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l660" id="BVIII_l660"></a>660</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The bard divine began, continual flow<br></span>
<span class="i0">The stranger’s sorrows, by remembrance caused<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of some great woe which wraps his soul around.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, let the bard suspend his song, that all<br></span>
<span class="i0">(As most befits th’ occasion) may rejoice,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both guest and hosts together; since we make<br></span>
<span class="i0">This voyage, and these gifts confer, in proof<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of hospitality and unfeign’d love,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Judging, with all wise men, the stranger-guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">And suppliant worthy of a brother’s place. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l670" id="BVIII_l670"></a>670</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And thou conceal not, artfully reserv’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">What I shall ask, far better plain declared<br></span>
<span class="i0">Than smother’d close; who art thou? speak thy name,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The name by which thy father, mother, friends<br></span>
<span class="i0">And fellow-citizens, with all who dwell<br></span>
<span class="i0">Around thy native city, in times past<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have known thee; for of all things human none<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lives altogether nameless, whether good<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or whether bad, but ev’ry man receives<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ev’n in the moment of his birth, a name. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l680" id="BVIII_l680"></a>680</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy country, people, city, tell; the mark<br></span>
<span class="i0">At which my ships, intelligent, shall aim,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That they may bear thee thither; for our ships<br></span>
<span class="i0">No pilot need or helm, as ships are wont,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But know, themselves, our purpose; know beside<br></span>
<span class="i0">All cities, and all fruitful regions well<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the earth, and with dark clouds involv’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Plough rapid the rough Deep, fearless of harm,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Whate’er betide) and of disast’rous wreck.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet thus, long since, my father I have heard <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l690" id="BVIII_l690"></a>690</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Nausithoüs speaking; Neptune, he would say,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is angry with us, for that safe we bear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Strangers of ev’ry nation to their home;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he foretold a time when he would smite<br></span>
<span class="i0">In vengeance some Phæacian gallant bark<br></span>
<span class="i0">Returning after convoy of her charge,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And fix her in the sable flood, transform’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into a mountain, right before the town.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake my hoary Sire, which let the God<br></span>
<span class="i0">At his own pleasure do, or leave undone. <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l700" id="BVIII_l700"></a>700</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But tell me truth, and plainly. Where have been<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy wand’rings? in what regions of the earth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou arrived? what nations hast thou seen,<br></span>
<span class="i0">What cities? say, how many hast thou found<br></span>
<span class="i0">Harsh, savage and unjust? how many, kind<br></span>
<span class="i0">To strangers, and disposed to fear the Gods?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Say also, from what secret grief of heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy sorrows flow, oft as thou hear’st the fate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Achaians, or of Ilium sung?<br></span>
<span class="i0">That fate the Gods prepared; they spin the thread <span class="linenum"><a name="BVIII_l710" id="BVIII_l710"></a>710</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of man’s destruction, that in after days<br></span>
<span class="i0">The bard may make the sad event his theme.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Perish’d thy father or thy brother there?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or hast thou at the siege of Ilium lost<br></span>
<span class="i0">Father-in-law, or son-in-law? for such<br></span>
<span class="i0">Are next and dearest to us after those<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who share our own descent; or was the dead<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy bosom-friend, whose heart was as thy own?<br></span>
<span class="i0">For worthy as a brother of our love<br></span>

Agamemnon having inquired at Delphos, at what time the
Trojan war would end, was answered that the conclusion of it should
happen at a time when a dispute should arise between two of his principal
commanders. That dispute occurred at the time here alluded to, Achilles
recommending force as most likely to reduce the city, and Ulysses
stratagem.</p>

The original line has received such a variety of

a proverbial turn, which I have endeavoured to preserve, and have adopted
the sense of the words which appears best to accord with what immediately
follows. Vulcan pleads his own inability to enforce the demand, as a
circumstance that made Neptune’s promise unacceptable.</p>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">Ulysses discovers himself to the Phæacians, and begins the history of his
adventures. He destroys Ismarus, city of the Ciconians; arrives among the
Lotophagi; and afterwards at the land of the Cyclops. He is imprisoned by
Polypheme in his cave, who devours six of his companions; intoxicates the
monster with wine, <a class="correction" title="changed from 'binds'" href="#tnotes">blinds</a> him while he sleeps, and escapes from him.</p>

<span class="i0">Melodious, and the steaming tables spread<br></span>

<span class="i0">From brimming beakers fill’d, pass brisk around.<br></span>

<span class="i0">On whom the Gods have show’r’d such various woes?<br></span>

<span class="i0">Flat on the Deep she lies, farthest removed <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l30" id="BIX_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Toward the West, while, situate apart,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Rugged she is, but fruitful nurse of sons<br></span>
<span class="i0">Magnanimous; nor shall these eyes behold,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Calypso, beauteous Goddess, in her grot<br></span>

<span class="i0">Ææan Circe also, skill’d profound<br></span>

<span class="i0">Detain’d me, wishing me her own espoused; <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l40" id="BIX_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But never could they warp my constant mind.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So much our parents and our native soil<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attract us most, even although our lot<br></span>
<span class="i0">Be fair and plenteous in a foreign land.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But come—my painful voyage, such as Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gave me from Ilium, I will now relate.<br></span>
<span class="i1">From Troy the winds bore me to Ismarus,<br></span>
<span class="i0">City of the Ciconians; them I slew,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And laid their city waste; whence bringing forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Much spoil with all their wives, I portion’d it <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l50" id="BIX_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With equal hand, and each received a share.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Next, I exhorted to immediate flight<br></span>
<span class="i0">My people; but in vain; they madly scorn’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">My sober counsel, and much wine they drank,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And sheep and beeves slew num’rous on the shore.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, Ciconians to Ciconians call’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their neighbours summoning, a mightier host<br></span>
<span class="i0">And braver, natives of the continent,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Expert, on horses mounted, to maintain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce fight, or if occasion bade, on foot. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l60" id="BIX_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Num’rous they came as leaves, or vernal flow’rs<br></span>
<span class="i0">At day-spring. Then, by the decree of Jove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Misfortune found us. At the ships we stood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Piercing each other with the brazen spear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And till the morning brighten’d into noon,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Few as we were, we yet withstood them all;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, when the sun verged westward, then the Greeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fell back, and the Ciconian host prevail’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Six warlike Greecians from each galley’s crew<br></span>
<span class="i0">Perish’d in that dread field; the rest escaped. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l70" id="BIX_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus, after loss of many, we pursued<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our course, yet, difficult as was our flight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Went not till first we had invoked by name<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our friends, whom the Ciconians had destroy’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But cloud-assembler Jove assail’d us soon<br></span>
<span class="i0">With a tempestuous North-wind; earth alike<br></span>
<span class="i0">And sea with storms he overhung, and night<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fell fast from heav’n. Their heads deep-plunging oft<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our gallies flew, and rent, and rent again<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our tatter’d sail-cloth crackled in the wind. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l80" id="BIX_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">We, fearing instant death, within the barks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our canvas lodg’d, and, toiling strenuous, reach’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">At length the continent. Two nights we lay<br></span>
<span class="i0">Continual there, and two long days, consumed<br></span>
<span class="i0">With toil and grief; but when the beauteous morn<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bright-hair’d, had brought the third day to a close,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Our masts erected, and white sails unfurl’d)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Again we sat on board; meantime, the winds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Well managed by the steersman, urged us on.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now, all danger pass’d, I had attain’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l90" id="BIX_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">My native shore, but, doubling in my course<br></span>
<span class="i0">Malea, waves and currents and North-winds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Constrain’d me devious to Cythera’s isle.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nine days by cruel storms thence was I borne<br></span>
<span class="i0">Athwart the fishy Deep, but on the tenth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reach’d the Lotophagi, a race sustain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">On sweetest fruit alone. There quitting ship,<br></span>
<span class="i0">We landed and drew water, and the crews<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the vessels took their ev’ning cheer.<br></span>
<span class="i0">When, hasty, we had thus our strength renew’d, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l100" id="BIX_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I order’d forth my people to inquire<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Two I selected from the rest, with whom<br></span>
<span class="i0">I join’d an herald, third) what race of men<br></span>
<span class="i0">Might there inhabit. They, departing, mix’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With the Lotophagi; nor hostile aught<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or savage the Lotophagi devised<br></span>
<span class="i0">Against our friends, but offer’d to their taste<br></span>
<span class="i0">The lotus; of which fruit what man soe’er<br></span>
<span class="i0">Once tasted, no desire felt he to come<br></span>
<span class="i0">With tidings back, or seek his country more, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l110" id="BIX_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But rather wish’d to feed on lotus still<br></span>
<span class="i0">With the Lotophagi, and to renounce<br></span>
<span class="i0">All thoughts of home. Them, therefore, I constrain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Weeping on board, and dragging each beneath<br></span>
<span class="i0">The benches, bound him there. Then, all in haste,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I urged my people to ascend again<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their hollow barks, lest others also, fed<br></span>
<span class="i0">With fruit of lotus, should forget their home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They quick embark’d, and on the benches ranged<br></span>
<span class="i0">In order, thresh’d with oars the foamy flood. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l120" id="BIX_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Thence, o’er the Deep proceeding sad, we reach’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The land at length, where, giant-sized<a name="fnm_32" id="fnm_32"></a><a href="#fn_32" class="fnnum">32</a> and free<br></span>
<span class="i0">From all constraint of law, the Cyclops dwell.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They, trusting to the Gods, plant not, or plough,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But earth unsow’d, untill’d, brings forth for them<br></span>
<span class="i0">All fruits, wheat, barley, and the vinous grape<br></span>
<span class="i0">Large cluster’d, nourish’d by the show’rs of Jove.<br></span>
<span class="i0">No councils they convene, no laws contrive,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But in deep caverns dwell, found on the heads<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of lofty mountains, judging each supreme <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l130" id="BIX_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His wife and children, heedless of the rest.<br></span>
<span class="i0">In front of the Cyclopean haven lies<br></span>
<span class="i0">A level island, not adjoining close<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their land, nor yet remote, woody and rude.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There, wild goats breed numberless, by no foot<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of man molested; never huntsman there,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Inured to winter’s cold and hunger, roams<br></span>
<span class="i0">The dreary woods, or mountain-tops sublime;<br></span>
<span class="i0">No fleecy flocks dwell there, nor plough is known,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But the unseeded and unfurrow’d soil, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l140" id="BIX_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Year after year a wilderness by man<br></span>
<span class="i0">Untrodden, food for blatant goats supplies.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For no ships crimson-prow’d the Cyclops own,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor naval artizan is there, whose toil<br></span>
<span class="i0">Might furnish them with oary barks, by which<br></span>
<span class="i0">Subsists all distant commerce, and which bear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Man o’er the Deep to cities far remote<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who might improve the peopled isle, that seems<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not steril in itself, but apt to yield,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In their due season, fruits of ev’ry kind. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l150" id="BIX_l150"></a>150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For stretch’d beside the hoary ocean lie<br></span>
<span class="i0">Green meadows moist, where vines would never fail;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Light is the land, and they might yearly reap<br></span>
<span class="i0">The tallest crops, so unctuous is the glebe.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Safe is its haven also, where no need<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of cable is or anchor, or to lash<br></span>
<span class="i0">The hawser fast ashore, but pushing in<br></span>
<span class="i0">His bark, the mariner might there abide<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till rising gales should tempt him forth again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At bottom of the bay runs a clear stream <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l160" id="BIX_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Issuing from a cove hemm’d all around<br></span>
<span class="i0">With poplars; down into that bay we steer’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the darkness of the night, some God<br></span>
<span class="i0">Conducting us; for all unseen it lay,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such gloom involved the fleet, nor shone the moon<br></span>
<span class="i0">From heav’n to light us, veil’d by pitchy clouds.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hence, none the isle descried, nor any saw<br></span>
<span class="i0">The lofty surge roll’d on the strand, or ere<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our vessels struck the ground; but when they struck,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, low’ring all our sails, we disembark’d, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l170" id="BIX_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And on the sea-beach slept till dawn appear’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Soon as Aurora, daughter of the dawn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Look’d rosy forth, we with admiring eyes<br></span>
<span class="i0">The isle survey’d, roaming it wide around.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, the nymphs, Jove’s daughters, roused the goats<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bred on the mountains, to supply with food<br></span>
<span class="i0">The partners of my toils; then, bringing forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bows and long-pointed javelins from the ships,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Divided all into three sep’rate bands<br></span>
<span class="i0">We struck them, and the Gods gave us much prey. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l180" id="BIX_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Twelve ships attended me, and ev’ry ship<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nine goats received by lot; myself alone<br></span>
<span class="i0">Selected ten. All day, till set of sun,<br></span>
<span class="i0">We eating sat goat’s flesh, and drinking wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Delicious, without stint; for dearth was none<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of ruddy wine on board, but much remain’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With which my people had their jars supplied<br></span>
<span class="i0">What time we sack’d Ciconian Ismarus.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thence looking forth toward the neighbour-land<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where dwell the Cyclops, rising smoke we saw, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l190" id="BIX_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And voices heard, their own, and of their flocks.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now sank the sun, and (night o’ershadowing all)<br></span>
<span class="i0">We slept along the shore; but when again<br></span>
<span class="i0">The rosy-finger’d daughter of the dawn<br></span>
<span class="i0">Look’d forth, my crews convened, I thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Companions of my course! here rest ye all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Save my own crew, with whom I will explore<br></span>
<span class="i0">This people, whether wild, they be, unjust,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to contention giv’n, or well-disposed<br></span>
<span class="i0">To strangers, and a race who fear the Gods. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l200" id="BIX_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">So speaking, I embark’d, and bade embark<br></span>
<span class="i0">My followers, throwing, quick, the hawsers loose.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They, ent’ring at my word, the benches fill’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Well-ranged, and thresh’d with oars the foamy flood.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attaining soon that neighbour-land, we found<br></span>
<span class="i0">At its extremity, fast by the sea,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A cavern, lofty, and dark-brow’d above<br></span>
<span class="i0">With laurels; in that cavern slumb’ring lay<br></span>
<span class="i0">Much cattle, sheep and goats, and a broad court<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enclosed it, fenced with stones from quarries hewn, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l210" id="BIX_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With spiry firs, and oaks of ample bough.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here dwelt a giant vast, who far remote<br></span>
<span class="i0">His flocks fed solitary, converse none<br></span>
<span class="i0">Desiring, sullen, savage, and unjust.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Monster, in truth, he was, hideous in form,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Resembling less a man by Ceres’ gift<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sustain’d, than some aspiring mountain-crag<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tufted with wood, and standing all alone.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enjoining, then, my people to abide<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fast by the ship which they should closely guard, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l220" id="BIX_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I went, but not without a goat-skin fill’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With sable wine which I had erst received<br></span>
<span class="i0">From Maron, offspring of Evanthes, priest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Phœbus guardian god of Ismarus,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Because, through rev’rence of him, we had saved<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself, his wife and children; for he dwelt<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the grove umbrageous of his God.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He gave me, therefore, noble gifts; from him<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sev’n talents I received of beaten gold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A beaker, argent all, and after these <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l230" id="BIX_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">No fewer than twelve jars with wine replete,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rich, unadult’rate, drink for Gods; nor knew<br></span>
<span class="i0">One servant, male or female, of that wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">In all his house; none knew it, save himself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His wife, and the intendant of his stores.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oft as they drank that luscious juice, he slaked<br></span>
<span class="i0">A single cup with twenty from the stream,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, even then, the beaker breath’d abroad<br></span>
<span class="i0">A scent celestial, which whoever smelt,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thenceforth no pleasure found it to abstain. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l240" id="BIX_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Charged with an ample goat-skin of this wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">I went, and with a wallet well supplied,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But felt a sudden presage in my soul<br></span>
<span class="i0">That, haply, with terrific force endued,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some savage would appear, strange to the laws<br></span>
<span class="i0">And privileges of the human race.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Few steps convey’d us to his den, but him<br></span>
<span class="i0">We found not; he his flocks pastur’d abroad.<br></span>
<span class="i0">His cavern ent’ring, we with wonder gazed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Around on all; his strainers hung with cheese <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l250" id="BIX_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Distended wide; with lambs and kids his penns<br></span>
<span class="i0">Close-throng’d we saw, and folded separate<br></span>
<span class="i0">The various charge; the eldest all apart,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Apart the middle-aged, and the new-yean’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Also apart. His pails and bowls with whey<br></span>
<span class="i0">Swam all, neat vessels into which he milk’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Me then my friends first importuned to take<br></span>
<span class="i0">A portion of his cheeses, then to drive<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from the sheep-cotes to the rapid bark<br></span>
<span class="i0">His kids and lambs, and plow the brine again. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l260" id="BIX_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But me they moved not, happier had they moved!<br></span>
<span class="i0">I wish’d to see him, and to gain, perchance,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some pledge of hospitality at his hands,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose form was such, as should not much bespeak<br></span>
<span class="i0">When he appear’d, our confidence or love.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, kindling fire, we offer’d to the Gods,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And of his cheeses eating, patient sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till home he trudged from pasture. Charged he came<br></span>
<span class="i0">With dry wood bundled, an enormous load<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fuel by which to sup. Loud crash’d the thorns <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l270" id="BIX_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Which down he cast before the cavern’s mouth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To whose interior nooks we trembling flew.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At once he drove into his spacious cave<br></span>
<span class="i0">His batten’d flock, all those which gave him milk,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But all the males, both rams and goats, he left<br></span>
<span class="i0">Abroad, excluded from the cavern-yard.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Upheaving, next, a rocky barrier huge<br></span>
<span class="i0">To his cave’s mouth, he thrust it home. That weight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not all the oxen from its place had moved<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of twenty and two wains; with such a rock <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l280" id="BIX_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Immense his den he closed. Then down he sat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And as he milk’d his ewes and bleating goats<br></span>
<span class="i0">All in their turns, her yeanling gave to each;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Coagulating, then, with brisk dispatch,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The half of his new milk, he thrust the curd<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into his wicker sieves, but stored the rest<br></span>
<span class="i0">In pans and bowls—his customary drink.<br></span>
<span class="i0">His labours thus perform’d, he kindled, last,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His fuel, and discerning <i>us</i>, enquired,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Who are ye, strangers? from what distant shore <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l290" id="BIX_l290"></a>290</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Roam ye the waters? traffic ye? or bound<br></span>
<span class="i0">To no one port, wander, as pirates use,<br></span>
<span class="i0">At large the Deep, exposing life themselves,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And enemies of all mankind beside?<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceased; we, dash’d with terrour, heard the growl<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of his big voice, and view’d his form uncouth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To whom, though sore appall’d, I thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Of Greece are we, and, bound from Ilium home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have wander’d wide the expanse of ocean, sport<br></span>
<span class="i0">For ev’ry wind, and driven from our course, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l300" id="BIX_l300"></a>300</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Have here arrived; so stood the will of Jove.<br></span>
<span class="i0">We boast ourselves of Agamemnon’s train,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The son of Atreus, at this hour the Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond all others under heav’n renown’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So great a city he hath sack’d and slain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such num’rous foes; but since we reach, at last,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy knees, we beg such hospitable fare,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or other gift, as guests are wont to obtain.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Illustrious lord! respect the Gods, and us<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy suitors; suppliants are the care of Jove <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l310" id="BIX_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The hospitable; he their wrongs resents<br></span>
<span class="i0">And where the stranger sojourns, there is he.<br></span>
<span class="i1">I ceas’d, when answer thus he, fierce, return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Friend! either thou art fool, or hast arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">Indeed from far, who bidd’st me fear the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lest they be wroth. The Cyclops little heeds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Jove Ægis-arm’d, or all the Pow’rs of heav’n.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our race is mightier far; nor shall myself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Through fear of Jove’s hostility, abstain<br></span>
<span class="i0">From thee or thine, unless my choice be such. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l320" id="BIX_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But tell me now. Where touch’d thy gallant bark<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our country, on thy first arrival here?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Remote or nigh? for I would learn the truth.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake he, tempting me; but, artful, thus<br></span>
<span class="i0">I answer’d, penetrating his intent.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My vessel, Neptune, Shaker of the shores,<br></span>
<span class="i0">At yonder utmost promontory dash’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">In pieces, hurling her against the rocks<br></span>
<span class="i0">With winds that blew right thither from the sea,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I, with these alone, escaped alive. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l330" id="BIX_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">So I, to whom, relentless, answer none<br></span>
<span class="i0">He deign’d, but, with his arms extended, sprang<br></span>
<span class="i0">Toward my people, of whom seizing two<br></span>
<span class="i0">At once, like whelps against his cavern-floor<br></span>
<span class="i0">He dash’d them, and their brains spread on the ground.<br></span>
<span class="i0">These, piece-meal hewn, for supper he prepared,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, like a mountain-lion, neither flesh<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor entrails left, nor yet their marrowy bones.<br></span>
<span class="i0">We, viewing that tremendous sight, upraised<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our hands to Jove, all hope and courage lost. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l340" id="BIX_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">When thus the Cyclops had with human flesh<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fill’d his capacious belly, and had quaff’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Much undiluted milk, among his flocks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Out-stretch’d immense, he press’d his cavern-floor.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Me, then, my courage prompted to approach<br></span>
<span class="i0">The monster with my sword drawn from the sheath,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to transfix him where the vitals wrap<br></span>
<span class="i0">The liver; but maturer thoughts forbad.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For so, we also had incurred a death<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tremendous, wanting pow’r to thrust aside <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l350" id="BIX_l350"></a>350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The rocky mass that closed his cavern-mouth<br></span>
<span class="i0">By force of hand alone. Thus many a sigh<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heaving, we watch’d the dawn. But when, at length,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Aurora, day-spring’s daughter rosy-palm’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Look’d forth, then, kindling fire, his flocks he milk’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">In order, and her yeanling kid or lamb<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thrust under each. When thus he had perform’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">His wonted task, two seizing, as before,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He slew them for his next obscene regale.<br></span>
<span class="i0">His dinner ended, from the cave he drove <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l360" id="BIX_l360"></a>360</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His fatted flocks abroad, moving with ease<br></span>
<span class="i0">That pond’rous barrier, and replacing it<br></span>
<span class="i0">As he had only closed a quiver’s lid.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, hissing them along, he drove his flocks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Toward the mountain, and me left, the while,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deep ruminating how I best might take<br></span>
<span class="i0">Vengeance, and by the aid of Pallas win<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deathless renown. This counsel pleas’d me most.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the sheep-cote lay a massy club<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hewn by the Cyclops from an olive stock, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l370" id="BIX_l370"></a>370</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Green, but which dried, should serve him for a staff.<br></span>
<span class="i0">To us consid’ring it, that staff appear’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tall as the mast of a huge trading bark,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Impell’d by twenty rowers o’er the Deep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such seem’d its length to us, and such its bulk.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Part amputating, (an whole fathom’s length)<br></span>
<span class="i0">I gave my men that portion, with command<br></span>
<span class="i0">To shave it smooth. They smooth’d it, and myself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shaping its blunt extremity to a point,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Season’d it in the fire; then cov’ring close <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l380" id="BIX_l380"></a>380</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The weapon, hid it under litter’d straw,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For much lay scatter’d on the cavern-floor.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now I bade my people cast the lot<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who of us all should take the pointed brand,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And grind it in his eye when next he slept.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The lots were cast, and four were chosen, those<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom most I wish’d, and I was chosen fifth.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At even-tide he came, his fleecy flocks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pasturing homeward, and compell’d them all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into his cavern, leaving none abroad, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l390" id="BIX_l390"></a>390</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Either through some surmise, or so inclined<br></span>
<span class="i0">By influence, haply, of the Gods themselves.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The huge rock pull’d into its place again<br></span>
<span class="i0">At the cave’s mouth, he, sitting, milk’d his sheep<br></span>
<span class="i0">And goats in order, and her kid or lamb<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thrust under each; thus, all his work dispatch’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Two more he seiz’d, and to his supper fell.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I then, approaching to him, thus address’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Cyclops, holding in my hands a cup<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of ivy-wood, well-charg’d with ruddy wine. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l400" id="BIX_l400"></a>400</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Lo, Cyclops! this is wine. Take this and drink<br></span>
<span class="i0">After thy meal of man’s flesh. Taste and learn<br></span>
<span class="i0">What precious liquor our lost vessel bore.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I brought it hither, purposing to make<br></span>
<span class="i0">Libation to thee, if to pity inclined<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou would’st dismiss us home. But, ah, thy rage<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is insupportable! thou cruel one!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, thinkest thou, of all mankind, henceforth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will visit <i>thee</i>, guilty of such excess?<br></span>
<span class="i1">I ceas’d. He took and drank, and hugely pleas’d<a name="fnm_33" id="fnm_33"></a><a href="#fn_33" class="fnnum">33</a> <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l410" id="BIX_l410"></a>410</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With that delicious bev’rage, thus enquir’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Give me again, and spare not. Tell me, too,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy name, incontinent, that I may make<br></span>
<span class="i0">Requital, gratifying also thee<br></span>
<span class="i0">With somewhat to thy taste. We Cyclops own<br></span>
<span class="i0">A bounteous soil, which yields <i>us</i> also wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">From clusters large, nourish’d by show’rs from Jove;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But this—this is from above—a stream<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of nectar and ambrosia, all divine!<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, and received a second draught, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l420" id="BIX_l420"></a>420</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Like measure. Thrice I bore it to his hand,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, foolish, thrice he drank. But when the fumes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Began to play around the Cyclops’ brain,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With show of amity I thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Cyclops! thou hast my noble name enquired,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which I will tell thee. Give me, in return,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The promised boon, some hospitable pledge.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My name is Outis,<a name="fnm_34" id="fnm_34"></a><a href="#fn_34" class="fnnum">34</a> Outis I am call’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">At home, abroad; wherever I am known.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So I; to whom he, savage, thus replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l430" id="BIX_l430"></a>430</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Outis, when I have eaten all his friends,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall be my last regale. Be that thy boon.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake, and, downward sway’d, fell resupine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With his huge neck aslant. All-conqu’ring sleep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Soon seized him. From his gullet gush’d the wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">With human morsels mingled, many a blast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sonorous issuing from his glutted maw.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, thrusting far the spike of olive-wood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into the embers glowing on the hearth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I heated it, and cheer’d my friends, the while, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l440" id="BIX_l440"></a>440</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Lest any should, through fear, shrink from his part.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when that stake of olive-wood, though green,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should soon have flamed, for it was glowing hot,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I bore it to his side. Then all my aids<br></span>
<span class="i0">Around me gather’d, and the Gods infused<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heroic fortitude into our hearts.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They, seizing the hot stake rasp’d to a point,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bored his eye with it, and myself, advanced<br></span>
<span class="i0">To a superior stand, twirled it about.<br></span>
<span class="i0">As when a shipwright with his wimble bores <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l450" id="BIX_l450"></a>450</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Tough oaken timber, placed on either side<br></span>
<span class="i0">Below, his fellow-artists strain the thong<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alternate, and the restless iron spins,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So, grasping hard the stake pointed with fire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">We twirl’d it in his eye; the bubbling blood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Boil’d round about the brand; his pupil sent<br></span>
<span class="i0">A scalding vapour forth that sing’d his brow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And all his eye-roots crackled in the flame.<br></span>
<span class="i0">As when the smith an hatchet or large axe<br></span>
<span class="i0">Temp’ring with skill, plunges the hissing blade <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l460" id="BIX_l460"></a>460</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in cold water, (whence the strength of steel)<br></span>
<span class="i0">So hiss’d his eye around the olive-wood.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The howling monster with his outcry fill’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The hollow rock, and I, with all my aids,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fled terrified. He, plucking forth the spike<br></span>
<span class="i0">From his burnt socket, mad with anguish, cast<br></span>
<span class="i0">The implement all bloody far away.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, bellowing, he sounded forth the name<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of ev’ry Cyclops dwelling in the caves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Around him, on the wind-swept mountain-tops; <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l470" id="BIX_l470"></a>470</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">They, at his cry flocking from ev’ry part,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Circled his den, and of his ail enquired.<br></span>
<span class="i1">What grievous hurt hath caused thee, Polypheme!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus yelling to alarm the peaceful ear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of night, and break our slumbers? Fear’st thou lest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some mortal man drive off thy flocks? or fear’st<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thyself to die by cunning or by force?<br></span>
<span class="i1">Them answer’d, then, Polypheme from his cave.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, friends! I die! and Outis gives the blow.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom with accents wing’d his friends without. <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l480" id="BIX_l480"></a>480</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">If no man<a name="fnm_35" id="fnm_35"></a><a href="#fn_35" class="fnnum">35</a> harm thee, but thou art alone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And sickness feel’st, it is the stroke of Jove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thou must bear it; yet invoke for aid<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy father Neptune, Sovereign of the floods.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, they went, and in my heart I laugh’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">That by the fiction only of a name,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slight stratagem! I had deceived them all.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then groan’d the Cyclops wrung with pain and grief,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, fumbling, with stretch’d hands, removed the rock<br></span>
<span class="i0">From his cave’s mouth, which done, he sat him down <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l490" id="BIX_l490"></a>490</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Spreading his arms athwart the pass, to stop<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our egress with his flocks abroad; so dull,<br></span>
<span class="i0">It seems, he held me, and so ill-advised.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I, pondering what means might fittest prove<br></span>
<span class="i0">To save from instant death, (if save I might)<br></span>
<span class="i0">My people and myself, to ev’ry shift<br></span>
<span class="i0">Inclined, and various counsels framed, as one<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who strove for life, conscious of woe at hand.<br></span>
<span class="i0">To me, thus meditating, this appear’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The likeliest course. The rams well-thriven were, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l500" id="BIX_l500"></a>500</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thick-fleeced, full-sized, with wool of sable hue.<br></span>
<span class="i0">These, silently, with osier twigs on which<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Cyclops, hideous monster, slept, I bound,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Three in one leash; the intermediate rams<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bore each a man, whom the exterior two<br></span>
<span class="i0">Preserved, concealing him on either side.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus each was borne by three, and I, at last,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The curl’d back seizing of a ram, (for one<br></span>
<span class="i0">I had reserv’d far stateliest of them all)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slipp’d underneath his belly, and both hands <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l510" id="BIX_l510"></a>510</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Enfolding fast in his exub’rant fleece,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Clung ceaseless to him as I lay supine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">We, thus disposed, waited with many a sigh<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sacred dawn; but when, at length, aris’n,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Aurora, day-spring’s daughter rosy-palm’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Again appear’d, the males of all his flocks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rush’d forth to pasture, and, meantime, unmilk’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The wethers bleated, by the load distress’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of udders overcharged. Their master, rack’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With pain intolerable, handled yet <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l520" id="BIX_l520"></a>520</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The backs of all, inquisitive, as they stood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, gross of intellect, suspicion none<br></span>
<span class="i0">Conceiv’d of men beneath their bodies bound.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now (none left beside) the ram approach’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With his own wool burthen’d, and with myself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom many a fear molested. Polypheme<br></span>
<span class="i0">The giant stroak’d him as he sat, and said,<br></span>
<span class="i1">My darling ram! why latest of the flock<br></span>
<span class="i0">Com’st thou, whom never, heretofore, my sheep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Could leave behind, but stalking at their head, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l530" id="BIX_l530"></a>530</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou first was wont to crop the tender grass,<br></span>
<span class="i0">First to arrive at the clear stream, and first<br></span>
<span class="i0">With ready will to seek my sheep-cote here<br></span>
<span class="i0">At evening; but, thy practice chang’d, thou com’st,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now last of all. Feel’st thou regret, my ram!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy poor master’s eye, by a vile wretch<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bored out, who overcame me first with wine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And by a crew of vagabonds accurs’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Followers of Outis, whose escape from death<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall not be made to-day? Ah! that thy heart <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l540" id="BIX_l540"></a>540</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Were as my own, and that distinct as I<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou could’st articulate, so should’st thou tell,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where hidden, he eludes my furious wrath.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, dash’d against the floor his spatter’d brain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should fly, and I should lighter feel my harm<br></span>
<span class="i0">From Outis, wretch base-named and nothing-worth.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he left him to pursue the flock.<br></span>
<span class="i0">When, thus drawn forth, we had, at length, escaped<br></span>
<span class="i0">Few paces from the cavern and the court,<br></span>
<span class="i0">First, quitting my own ram, I loos’d my friends, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l550" id="BIX_l550"></a>550</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, turning seaward many a thriven ewe<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sharp-hoof’d, we drove them swiftly to the ship.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice welcome to our faithful friends we came<br></span>
<span class="i0">From death escaped, but much they mourn’d the dead.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I suffer’d not their tears, but silent shook<br></span>
<span class="i0">My brows, by signs commanding them to lift<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sheep on board, and instant plow the main.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They, quick embarking, on the benches sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Well ranged, and thresh’d with oars the foamy flood;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But distant now such length as a loud voice <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l560" id="BIX_l560"></a>560</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">May reach, I hail’d with taunts the Cyclops’ ear.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Cyclops! when thou devouredst in thy cave<br></span>
<span class="i0">With brutal force my followers, thou devour’dst<br></span>
<span class="i0">The followers of no timid Chief, or base,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Vengeance was sure to recompense that deed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Atrocious. Monster! who wast not afraid<br></span>
<span class="i0">To eat the guest shelter’d beneath thy roof!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore the Gods have well requited thee.<br></span>
<span class="i1">I ended; he, exasp’rate, raged the more,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And rending from its hold a mountain-top, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l570" id="BIX_l570"></a>570</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Hurl’d it toward us; at our vessel’s stern<br></span>
<span class="i0">Down came the mass, nigh sweeping in its fall<br></span>
<span class="i0">The rudder’s head. The ocean at the plunge<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of that huge rock, high on its refluent flood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heav’d, irresistible, the ship to land.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I seizing, quick, our longest pole on board,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Back thrust her from the coast and by a nod<br></span>
<span class="i0">In silence given, bade my companions ply<br></span>
<span class="i0">Strenuous their oars, that so we might escape.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Procumbent,<a name="fnm_36" id="fnm_36"></a><a href="#fn_36" class="fnnum">36</a> each obey’d, and when, the flood <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l580" id="BIX_l580"></a>580</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Cleaving, we twice that distance had obtain’d,<a name="fnm_37" id="fnm_37"></a><a href="#fn_37" class="fnnum">37</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">Again I hail’d the Cyclops; but my friends<br></span>
<span class="i0">Earnest dissuaded me on ev’ry side.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ah, rash Ulysses! why with taunts provoke<br></span>
<span class="i0">The savage more, who hath this moment hurl’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">A weapon, such as heav’d the ship again<br></span>
<span class="i0">To land, where death seem’d certain to us all?<br></span>
<span class="i0">For had he heard a cry, or but the voice<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of one man speaking, he had all our heads<br></span>
<span class="i0">With some sharp rock, and all our timbers crush’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l590" id="BIX_l590"></a>590</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Together, such vast force is in his arm.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So they, but my courageous heart remain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unmoved, and thus again, incensed, I spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Cyclops! should any mortal man inquire<br></span>
<span class="i0">To whom thy shameful loss of sight thou ow’st,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Say, to Ulysses, city-waster Chief,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laertes’ son, native of Ithaca.<br></span>
<span class="i1">I ceas’d, and with a groan thus he replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ah me! an antient oracle I feel<br></span>
<span class="i0">Accomplish’d. Here abode a prophet erst, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l600" id="BIX_l600"></a>600</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A man of noblest form, and in his art<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unrivall’d, Telemus Eurymedes.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He, prophesying to the Cyclops-race,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grew old among us, and presaged my loss<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of sight, in future, by Ulysses’ hand.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I therefore watch’d for the arrival here,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Always, of some great Chief, for stature, bulk<br></span>
<span class="i0">And beauty prais’d, and cloath’d with wond’rous might.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But now—a dwarf, a thing impalpable,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A shadow, overcame me first by wine, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l610" id="BIX_l610"></a>610</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then quench’d my sight. Come hither, O my guest!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Return, Ulysses! hospitable cheer<br></span>
<span class="i0">Awaits thee, and my pray’rs I will prefer<br></span>
<span class="i0">To glorious Neptune for thy prosp’rous course;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For I am Neptune’s offspring, and the God<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is proud to be my Sire; he, if he please,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he alone can heal me; none beside<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Pow’rs immortal, or of men below.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake, to whom I answer thus return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I would that of thy life and soul amerced, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l620" id="BIX_l620"></a>620</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I could as sure dismiss thee down to Hell,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As none shall heal thine eye—not even He.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So I; then pray’d the Cyclops to his Sire<br></span>
<span class="i0">With hands uprais’d towards the starry heav’n.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Hear, Earth-encircler Neptune, azure-hair’d!<br></span>
<span class="i0">If I indeed am thine, and if thou boast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thyself my father, grant that never more<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, leveller of hostile tow’rs,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laertes’ son, of Ithaca the fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Behold his native home! but if his fate <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l630" id="BIX_l630"></a>630</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Decree him yet to see his friends, his house,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His native country, let him deep distress’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Return and late, all his companions lost,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Indebted for a ship to foreign aid,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And let affliction meet him at his door.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake, and Ocean’s sov’reign heard his pray’r.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then lifting from the shore a stone of size<br></span>
<span class="i0">Far more enormous, o’er his head he whirl’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The rock, and his immeasurable force<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exerting all, dismiss’d it. Close behind <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l640" id="BIX_l640"></a>640</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The ship, nor distant from the rudder’s head,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Down came the mass. The ocean at the plunge<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of such a weight, high on its refluent flood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tumultuous, heaved the bark well nigh to land.<br></span>
<span class="i1">But when we reach’d the isle where we had left<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our num’rous barks, and where my people sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Watching with ceaseless sorrow our return,<br></span>
<span class="i0">We thrust our vessel to the sandy shore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then disembark’d, and of the Cyclops’ sheep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gave equal share to all. To me alone <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l650" id="BIX_l650"></a>650</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">My fellow-voyagers the ram consign’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">In distribution, my peculiar meed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Him, therefore, to cloud-girt Saturnian Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">I offer’d on the shore, burning his thighs<br></span>
<span class="i0">In sacrifice; but Jove my hallow’d rites<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reck’d not, destruction purposing to all<br></span>
<span class="i0">My barks, and all my followers o’er the Deep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, feasting largely, on the shore we sat<br></span>

<span class="i0">But when day fail’d, and night o’ershadow’d all, <span class="linenum"><a name="BIX_l660" id="BIX_l660"></a>660</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, on the shore we slept; and when again<br></span>

<span class="i0">To climb their barks, and cast the hawsers loose.<br></span>

Clarke, who has preserved this name in his marginal
version, contends strenuously, and with great reason, that Outis ought
not to be translated, and in a passage which he quotes from the <i>Acta
eruditorum</i>, we see much fault found with Giphanius and other
interpreters of Homer for having translated it. It is <a class="correction" title="changed from 'certian'" href="#tnotes">certain</a> that in
Homer the word is declined not as <span class="translit" title="outis-tinos">ουτις-τινος</span> which signifies no
man, but as <span class="translit" title="outis-tidos">ουτις-τιδος</span> making <span class="translit" title="outin">ουτιν</span> in the accusative,
consequently as a proper name. It is sufficient that the ambiguity was
such as to deceive the friends of the Cyclops. Outis is said by some
(perhaps absurdly) to have been a name given to Ulysses on account of his
having larger ears than common.</p>

Outis, as a <i>name</i> could only denote him who bore it; but
as a <i>noun</i>, it signifies <i>no man</i>, which accounts sufficiently for the
ludicrous mistake of his brethren.</p>

The seeming incongruity of this line with line 560, is
reconciled by supposing that Ulysses exerted his voice, naturally loud,
in an extraordinary manner on this second occasion. See Clarke.</p>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">Ulysses, in pursuit of his narrative, relates his arrival at the island
of Æolus, his departure thence, and the unhappy occasion of his return
thither. The monarch of the winds dismisses him at last with much
asperity. He next tells of his arrival among the Læstrygonians, by whom
his whole fleet, together with their crews, are destroyed, his own ship
and crew excepted. Thence he is driven to the island of Circe. By her the
half of his people are transformed into swine. Assisted by Mercury, he
resists her enchantments himself, and prevails with the Goddess to
recover them to their former shape. In consequence of Circe’s
instructions, after having spent a complete year in her palace, he
prepares for a voyage to the infernal regions.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We came to the Æolian isle; there dwells<br></span>
<span class="i0">Æolus, son of Hippotas, belov’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">By the Immortals, in an isle afloat.<br></span>
<span class="i0">A brazen wall impregnable on all sides<br></span>
<span class="i0">Girds it, and smooth its rocky coast ascends.<br></span>
<span class="i0">His children, in his own fair palace born,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Are twelve; six daughters, and six blooming sons.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He gave his daughters to his sons to wife;<br></span>
<span class="i0">They with their father hold perpetual feast<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with their royal mother, still supplied <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l10" id="BX_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With dainties numberless; the sounding dome<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is fill’d with sav’ry odours all the day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with their consorts chaste at night they sleep<br></span>
<span class="i0">On stateliest couches with rich arras spread.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their city and their splendid courts we reach’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">A month complete he, friendly, at his board<br></span>
<span class="i0">Regaled me, and enquiry made minute<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ilium’s fall, of the Achaian fleet,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And of our voyage thence. I told him all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But now, desirous to embark again, <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l20" id="BX_l20"></a>20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I ask’d dismission home, which he approved,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And well provided for my prosp’rous course.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He gave me, furnish’d by a bullock slay’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">In his ninth year, a bag; ev’ry rude blast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which from its bottom turns the Deep, that bag<br></span>
<span class="i0">Imprison’d held; for him Saturnian Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath officed arbiter of all the winds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To rouse their force or calm them, at his will.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He gave me them on board my bark, so bound<br></span>
<span class="i0">With silver twine that not a breath escaped, <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l30" id="BX_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then order’d gentle Zephyrus to fill<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our sails propitious. Order vain, alas!<br></span>
<span class="i0">So fatal proved the folly of my friends.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Nine days continual, night and day we sail’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And on the tenth my native land appear’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not far remote my Ithacans I saw<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fires kindling on the coast; but me with toil<br></span>
<span class="i0">Worn, and with watching, gentle sleep subdued;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For constant I had ruled the helm, nor giv’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">That charge to any, fearful of delay. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l40" id="BX_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, in close conference combined, my crew<br></span>
<span class="i0">Each other thus bespake—He carries home<br></span>
<span class="i0">Silver and gold from Æolus received,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Offspring of Hippotas, illustrious Chief—<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thus a mariner the rest harangued.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ye Gods! what city or what land soe’er<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses visits, how is he belov’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">By all, and honour’d! many precious spoils<br></span>
<span class="i0">He homeward bears from Troy; but we return,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(We who the self-same voyage have perform’d) <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l50" id="BX_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With empty hands. Now also he hath gain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">This pledge of friendship from the King of winds.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But come—be quick—search we the bag, and learn<br></span>
<span class="i0">What stores of gold and silver it contains.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So he, whose mischievous advice prevailed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They loos’d the bag; forth issued all the winds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, caught by tempests o’er the billowy waste,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Weeping they flew, far, far from Ithaca.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I then, awaking, in my noble mind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stood doubtful, whether from my vessel’s side <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l60" id="BX_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Immersed to perish in the flood, or calm<br></span>
<span class="i0">To endure my sorrows, and content to live.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I calm endured them; but around my head<br></span>
<span class="i0">Winding my mantle, lay’d me down below,<br></span>
<span class="i0">While adverse blasts bore all my fleet again<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the Æolian isle; then groan’d my people.<br></span>
<span class="i1">We disembark’d and drew fresh water there,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And my companions, at their galley’s sides<br></span>
<span class="i0">All seated, took repast; short meal we made,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When, with an herald and a chosen friend, <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l70" id="BX_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I sought once more the hall of Æolus.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Him banqueting with all his sons we found,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with his spouse; we ent’ring, on the floor<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of his wide portal sat, whom they amazed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld, and of our coming thus enquired.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Return’d? Ulysses! by what adverse Pow’r<br></span>
<span class="i0">Repuls’d hast thou arrived? we sent thee hence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Well-fitted forth to reach thy native isle,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy palace, or what place soe’er thou would’st.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So they—to whom, heart-broken, I replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l80" id="BX_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">My worthless crew have wrong’d me, nor alone<br></span>
<span class="i0">My worthless crew, but sleep ill-timed, as much.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet heal, O friends, my hurt; the pow’r is yours!<br></span>
<span class="i1">So I their favour woo’d. Mute sat the sons,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But thus their father answer’d. Hence—be gone—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Leave this our isle, thou most obnoxious wretch<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all mankind. I should, myself, transgress,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Receiving here, and giving conduct hence<br></span>
<span class="i0">To one detested by the Gods as thou.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Away—for hated by the Gods thou com’st. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l90" id="BX_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he sent me from his palace forth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Groaning profound; thence, therefore, o’er the Deep<br></span>
<span class="i0">We still proceeded sorrowful, our force<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exhausting ceaseless at the toilsome oar,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, through our own imprudence, hopeless now<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of other furth’rance to our native isle.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Six days we navigated, day and night,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The briny flood, and on the seventh reach’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The city erst by Lamus built sublime,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Proud Læstrygonia, with the distant gates. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l100" id="BX_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The herdsman, there, driving his cattle home,<a name="fnm_38" id="fnm_38"></a><a href="#fn_38" class="fnnum">38</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">Summons the shepherd with his flocks abroad.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sleepless there might double wages earn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attending, now, the herds, now, tending sheep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For the night-pastures, and the pastures grazed<br></span>
<span class="i0">By day, close border, both, the city-walls.<br></span>
<span class="i0">To that illustrious port we came, by rocks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Uninterrupted flank’d on either side<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of tow’ring height, while prominent the shores<br></span>
<span class="i0">And bold, converging at the haven’s mouth <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l110" id="BX_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Leave narrow pass. We push’d our galleys in,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then moor’d them side by side; for never surge<br></span>
<span class="i0">There lifts its head, or great or small, but clear<br></span>
<span class="i0">We found, and motionless, the shelter’d flood.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself alone, staying my bark without,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Secured her well with hawsers to a rock<br></span>
<span class="i0">At the land’s point, then climb’d the rugged steep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And spying stood the country. Labours none<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of men or oxen in the land appear’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor aught beside saw we, but from the earth <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l120" id="BX_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Smoke rising; therefore of my friends I sent<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before me two, adding an herald third,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To learn what race of men that country fed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Departing, they an even track pursued<br></span>
<span class="i0">Made by the waggons bringing timber down<br></span>
<span class="i0">From the high mountains to the town below.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before the town a virgin bearing forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her ew’r they met, daughter of him who ruled<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Læstrygonian race, Antiphatas.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Descending from the gate, she sought the fount <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l130" id="BX_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Artacia; for their custom was to draw<br></span>
<span class="i0">From that pure fountain for the city’s use.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Approaching they accosted her, and ask’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">What King reign’d there, and over whom he reign’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She gave them soon to know where stood sublime<br></span>
<span class="i0">The palace of her Sire; no sooner they<br></span>
<span class="i0">The palace enter’d, than within they found,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In size resembling an huge mountain-top,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A woman, whom they shudder’d to behold.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She forth from council summon’d quick her spouse <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l140" id="BX_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Antiphatas, who teeming came with thoughts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of carnage, and, arriving, seized at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">A Greecian, whom, next moment, he devoured.<br></span>
<span class="i0">With headlong terrour the surviving two<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fled to the ships. Then sent Antiphatas<br></span>
<span class="i0">His voice through all the town, and on all sides,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hearing that cry, the Læstrygonians flock’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Numberless, and in size resembling more<br></span>
<span class="i0">The giants than mankind. They from the rocks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cast down into our fleet enormous stones, <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l150" id="BX_l150"></a>150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A strong man’s burthen each; dire din arose<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of shatter’d galleys and of dying men,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom spear’d like fishes to their home they bore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A loathsome prey. While them within the port<br></span>
<span class="i0">They slaughter’d, I, (the faulchion at my side<br></span>
<span class="i0">Drawn forth) cut loose the hawser of my ship,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And all my crew enjoin’d with bosoms laid<br></span>
<span class="i0">Prone on their oars, to fly the threaten’d woe.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They, dreading instant death tugg’d resupine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Together, and the galley from beneath <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l160" id="BX_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Those beetling<a name="fnm_39" id="fnm_39"></a><a href="#fn_39" class="fnnum">39</a> rocks into the open sea<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shot gladly; but the rest all perish’d there.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Proceeding thence, we sigh’d, and roamed the waves,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Glad that we lived, but sorrowing for the slain.<br></span>
<span class="i0">We came to the Ææan isle; there dwelt<br></span>
<span class="i0">The awful Circe, Goddess amber-hair’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deep-skill’d in magic song, sister by birth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the all-wise Æætes; them the Sun,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bright luminary of the world, begat<br></span>
<span class="i0">On Perse, daughter of Oceanus. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l170" id="BX_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Our vessel there, noiseless, we push’d to land<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within a spacious haven, thither led<br></span>
<span class="i0">By some celestial Pow’r. We disembark’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And on the coast two days and nights entire<br></span>
<span class="i0">Extended lay, worn with long toil, and each<br></span>
<span class="i0">The victim of his heart-devouring woes.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, with my spear and with my faulchion arm’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I left the ship to climb with hasty steps<br></span>
<span class="i0">An airy height, thence, hoping to espie<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some works of man, or hear, perchance, a voice. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l180" id="BX_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Exalted on a rough rock’s craggy point<br></span>
<span class="i0">I stood, and on the distant plain, beheld<br></span>
<span class="i0">Smoke which from Circe’s palace through the gloom<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of trees and thickets rose. That smoke discern’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I ponder’d next if thither I should haste,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seeking intelligence. Long time I mused,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But chose at last, as my discreter course,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To seek the sea-beach and my bark again,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, when my crew had eaten, to dispatch<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before me, others, who should first enquire. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l190" id="BX_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But, ere I yet had reach’d my gallant bark,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some God with pity viewing me alone<br></span>
<span class="i0">In that untrodden solitude, sent forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">An antler’d stag, full-sized, into my path.<br></span>
<span class="i0">His woodland pastures left, he sought the stream,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For he was thirsty, and already parch’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">By the sun’s heat. Him issuing from his haunt,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sheer through the back beneath his middle spine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I wounded, and the lance sprang forth beyond.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Moaning he fell, and in the dust expired. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l200" id="BX_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, treading on his breathless trunk, I pluck’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">My weapon forth, which leaving there reclined,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I tore away the osiers with my hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">And fallows green, and to a fathom’s length<br></span>
<span class="i0">Twisting the gather’d twigs into a band,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bound fast the feet of my enormous prey,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, flinging him athwart my neck, repair’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Toward my sable bark, propp’d on my lance,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which now to carry shoulder’d as before<br></span>
<span class="i0">Surpass’d my pow’r, so bulky was the load. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l210" id="BX_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Arriving at the ship, there I let fall<br></span>
<span class="i0">My burthen, and with pleasant speech and kind,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Man after man addressing, cheer’d my crew.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My friends! we suffer much, but shall not seek<br></span>
<span class="i0">The shades, ere yet our destined hour arrive.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Behold a feast! and we have wine on board—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pine not with needless famine! rise and eat.<br></span>
<span class="i1">I spake; they readily obey’d, and each<br></span>
<span class="i0">Issuing at my word abroad, beside<br></span>
<span class="i0">The galley stood, admiring, as he lay, <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l220" id="BX_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The stag, for of no common bulk was he.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At length, their eyes gratified to the full<br></span>
<span class="i0">With that glad spectacle, they laved their hands,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And preparation made of noble cheer.<br></span>
<span class="i0">That day complete, till set of sun, we spent<br></span>
<span class="i0">Feasting deliciously without restraint,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And quaffing generous wine; but when the sun<br></span>
<span class="i0">Went down, and darkness overshadow’d all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Extended, then, on Ocean’s bank we lay;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And when Aurora, daughter of the dawn, <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l230" id="BX_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Look’d rosy forth, convening all my crew<br></span>
<span class="i0">To council, I arose, and thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My fellow-voyagers, however worn<br></span>
<span class="i0">With num’rous hardships, hear! for neither West<br></span>
<span class="i0">Know ye, nor East, where rises, or where sets<br></span>
<span class="i0">The all-enlight’ning sun. But let us think,<br></span>
<span class="i0">If thought perchance may profit us, of which<br></span>
<span class="i0">Small hope I see; for when I lately climb’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yon craggy rock, plainly I could discern<br></span>
<span class="i0">The land encompass’d by the boundless Deep. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l240" id="BX_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The isle is flat, and in the midst I saw<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dun smoke ascending from an oaken bow’r.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So I, whom hearing, they all courage lost,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And at remembrance of Antiphatas<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Læstrygonian, and the Cyclops’ deeds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ferocious feeder on the flesh of man,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mourn’d loud and wept, but tears could nought avail.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then numb’ring man by man, I parted them<br></span>
<span class="i0">In equal portions, and assign’d a Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">To either band, myself to these, to those <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l250" id="BX_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Godlike Eurylochus. This done, we cast<br></span>
<span class="i0">The lots into the helmet, and at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forth sprang the lot of bold Eurylochus.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He went, and with him of my people march’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Twenty and two, all weeping; nor ourselves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wept less, at separation from our friends.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Low in a vale, but on an open spot,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They found the splendid house of Circe, built<br></span>
<span class="i0">With hewn and polish’d stones; compass’d she dwelt<br></span>
<span class="i0">By lions on all sides and mountain-wolves <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l260" id="BX_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Tamed by herself with drugs of noxious pow’rs.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor were they mischievous, but as my friends<br></span>
<span class="i0">Approach’d, arising on their hinder feet,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Paw’d them in blandishment, and wagg’d the tail.<br></span>
<span class="i0">As, when from feast he rises, dogs around<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their master fawn, accustom’d to receive<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sop conciliatory from his hand,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Around my people, so, those talon’d wolves<br></span>
<span class="i0">And lions fawn’d. They, terrified, that troop<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of savage monsters horrible beheld. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l270" id="BX_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And now, before the Goddess’ gates arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They heard the voice of Circe singing sweet<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within, while, busied at the loom, she wove<br></span>
<span class="i0">An ample web immortal, such a work<br></span>
<span class="i0">Transparent, graceful, and of bright design<br></span>
<span class="i0">As hands of Goddesses alone produce.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus then Polites, Prince of men, the friend<br></span>
<span class="i0">Highest in my esteem, the rest bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ye hear the voice, comrades, of one who weaves<br></span>
<span class="i0">An ample web within, and at her task <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l280" id="BX_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">So sweetly chaunts that all the marble floor<br></span>
<span class="i0">Re-echoes; human be she or divine<br></span>
<span class="i0">I doubt, but let us call, that we may learn.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceas’d; they call’d; soon issuing at the sound,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Goddess open’d wide her splendid gates,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And bade them in; they, heedless, all complied,<br></span>
<span class="i0">All save Eurylochus, who fear’d a snare.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She, introducing them, conducted each<br></span>
<span class="i0">To a bright throne, then gave them Pramnian wine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With grated cheese, pure meal, and honey new, <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l290" id="BX_l290"></a>290</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But medicated with her pois’nous drugs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their food, that in oblivion they might lose<br></span>
<span class="i0">The wish of home. She gave them, and they drank,—<br></span>
<span class="i0">When, smiting each with her enchanting wand,<br></span>
<span class="i0">She shut them in her sties. In head, in voice,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In body, and in bristles they became<br></span>
<span class="i0">All swine, yet intellected as before,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And at her hand were dieted alone<br></span>
<span class="i0">With acorns, chestnuts, and the cornel-fruit,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Food grateful ever to the grovelling swine. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l300" id="BX_l300"></a>300</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Back flew Eurylochus toward the ship,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To tell the woeful tale; struggling to speak,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet speechless, there he stood, his heart transfixt<br></span>
<span class="i0">With anguish, and his eyes deluged with tears.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Me boding terrours occupied. At length,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When, gazing on him, all had oft enquired,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He thus rehearsed to us the dreadful change.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Renown’d Ulysses! as thou bad’st, we went<br></span>
<span class="i0">Through yonder oaks; there, bosom’d in a vale,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But built conspicuous on a swelling knoll <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l310" id="BX_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With polish’d rock, we found a stately dome.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within, some Goddess or some woman wove<br></span>
<span class="i0">An ample web, carolling sweet the while.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They call’d aloud; she, issuing at the voice,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unfolded, soon, her splendid portals wide,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And bade them in. Heedless they enter’d, all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But I remain’d, suspicious of a snare.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long the whole band vanish’d, none I saw<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thenceforth, though, seated there, long time I watch’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended; I my studded faulchion huge <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l320" id="BX_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Athwart my shoulder cast, and seized my bow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then bade him lead me thither by the way<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself had gone; but with both hands my knees<br></span>
<span class="i0">He clasp’d, and in wing’d accents sad exclaim’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My King! ah lead me not unwilling back,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But leave me here; for confident I judge<br></span>
<span class="i0">That neither thou wilt bring another thence,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor come thyself again. Haste—fly we swift<br></span>
<span class="i0">With these, for we, at least, may yet escape.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So he, to whom this answer I return’d. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l330" id="BX_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Eurylochus! abiding here, eat thou<br></span>
<span class="i0">And drink thy fill beside the sable bark;<br></span>
<span class="i0">I go; necessity forbids my stay.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, I left the galley and the shore.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But ere that awful vale ent’ring, I reach’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The palace of the sorceress, a God<br></span>
<span class="i0">Met me, the bearer of the golden wand,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hermes. He seem’d a stripling in his prime,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His cheeks cloath’d only with their earliest down,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For youth is then most graceful; fast he lock’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l340" id="BX_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His hand in mine, and thus, familiar, spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Unhappy! whither, wand’ring o’er the hills,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stranger to all this region, and alone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Go’st thou? Thy people—they within the walls<br></span>
<span class="i0">Are shut of Circe, where as swine close-pent<br></span>
<span class="i0">She keeps them. Comest thou to set them free?<br></span>
<span class="i0">I tell thee, never wilt thou thence return<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thyself, but wilt be prison’d with the rest.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet hearken—I will disappoint her wiles,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And will preserve thee. Take this precious drug; <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l350" id="BX_l350"></a>350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Possessing this, enter the Goddess’ house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Boldly, for it shall save thy life from harm.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lo! I reveal to thee the cruel arts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Circe; learn them. She will mix for thee<br></span>
<span class="i0">A potion, and will also drug thy food<br></span>
<span class="i0">With noxious herbs; but she shall not prevail<br></span>
<span class="i0">By all her pow’r to change thee; for the force<br></span>
<span class="i0">Superior of this noble plant, my gift,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall baffle her. Hear still what I advise.<br></span>
<span class="i0">When she shall smite thee with her slender rod, <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l360" id="BX_l360"></a>360</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With faulchion drawn and with death-threat’ning looks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rush on her; she will bid thee to her bed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Affrighted; then beware. Decline not thou<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her love, that she may both release thy friends,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And may with kindness entertain thyself.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But force her swear the dreaded oath of heav’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">That she will other mischief none devise<br></span>
<span class="i0">Against thee, lest she strip thee of thy might,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, quenching all thy virtue, make thee vile.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake the Argicide, and from the earth <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l370" id="BX_l370"></a>370</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That plant extracting, placed it in my hand,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then taught me all its pow’rs. Black was the root,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Milk-white the blossom; Moly is its name<br></span>
<span class="i0">In heav’n; not easily by mortal man<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dug forth, but all is easy to the Gods.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, Hermes through the island-woods repair’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To heav’n, and I to Circe’s dread abode,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In gloomy musings busied as I went.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within the vestibule arrived, where dwelt<br></span>
<span class="i0">The beauteous Goddess, staying there my steps, <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l380" id="BX_l380"></a>380</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I call’d aloud; she heard me, and at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">Issuing, threw her splendid portals wide,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And bade me in. I follow’d, heart-distress’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Leading me by the hand to a bright throne<br></span>
<span class="i0">With argent studs embellish’d, and beneath<br></span>
<span class="i0">Footstool’d magnificent, she made me sit.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then mingling for me in a golden cup<br></span>
<span class="i0">My bev’rage, she infused a drug, intent<br></span>
<span class="i0">On mischief; but when I had drunk the draught<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unchanged, she smote me with her wand, and said. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l390" id="BX_l390"></a>390</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Hence—seek the sty. There wallow with thy friends.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She spake; I drawing from beside my thigh<br></span>
<span class="i0">My faulchion keen, with death-denouncing looks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rush’d on her; she with a shrill scream of fear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ran under my rais’d arm, seized fast my knees,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in wing’d accents plaintive thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Who? whence? thy city and thy birth declare.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amazed I see thee with that potion drench’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet uninchanted; never man before<br></span>
<span class="i0">Once pass’d it through his lips, and liv’d the same; <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l400" id="BX_l400"></a>400</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But in thy breast a mind inhabits, proof<br></span>
<span class="i0">Against all charms. Come then—I know thee well.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art Ulysses artifice-renown’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of whose arrival here in his return<br></span>
<span class="i0">From Ilium, Hermes of the golden wand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was ever wont to tell me. Sheath again<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy sword, and let us, on my bed reclined,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mutual embrace, that we may trust thenceforth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Each other, without jealousy or fear.<br></span>
<span class="i1">The Goddess spake, to whom I thus replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l410" id="BX_l410"></a>410</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">O Circe! canst thou bid me meek become<br></span>
<span class="i0">And gentle, who beneath thy roof detain’st<br></span>
<span class="i0">My fellow-voyagers transform’d to swine?<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, fearing my escape, invit’st thou me<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into thy bed, with fraudulent pretext<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of love, that there, enfeebling by thy arts<br></span>
<span class="i0">My noble spirit, thou may’st make me vile?<br></span>
<span class="i0">No—trust me—never will I share thy bed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till first, O Goddess, thou consent to swear<br></span>
<span class="i0">The dread all-binding oath, that other harm <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l420" id="BX_l420"></a>420</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Against myself thou wilt imagine none.<br></span>
<span class="i1">I spake. She swearing as I bade, renounced<br></span>
<span class="i0">All evil purpose, and (her solemn oath<br></span>
<span class="i0">Concluded) I ascended, next, her bed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Magnificent. Meantime, four graceful nymphs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attended on the service of the house,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her menials, from the fountains sprung and groves,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And from the sacred streams that seek the sea.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of these, one cast fine linen on the thrones,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which, next, with purple arras rich she spread; <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l430" id="BX_l430"></a>430</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Another placed before the gorgeous seats<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bright tables, and set on baskets of gold.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The third, an argent beaker fill’d with wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Delicious, which in golden cups she served;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The fourth brought water, which she warm’d within<br></span>
<span class="i0">An ample vase, and when the simm’ring flood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sang in the tripod, led me to a bath,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And laved me with the pleasant stream profuse<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pour’d o’er my neck and body, till my limbs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Refresh’d, all sense of lassitude resign’d. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l440" id="BX_l440"></a>440</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">When she had bathed me, and with limpid oil<br></span>
<span class="i0">Anointed me, and cloathed me in a vest<br></span>
<span class="i0">And mantle, next, she led me to a throne<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of royal state, with silver studs emboss’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And footstool’d soft beneath; then came a nymph<br></span>
<span class="i0">With golden ewer charged and silver bowl,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who pour’d pure water on my hands, and placed<br></span>
<span class="i0">The polish’d board before me, which with food<br></span>
<span class="i0">Various, selected from her present stores,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The cat’ress spread, then, courteous, bade me eat. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l450" id="BX_l450"></a>450</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But me it pleas’d not; with far other thoughts<br></span>
<span class="i0">My spirit teem’d, on vengeance more intent.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Soon, then, as Circe mark’d me on my seat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fast-rooted, sullen, nor with outstretch’d hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deigning to touch the banquet, she approach’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in wing’d accents suasive thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Why sits Ulysses like the Dumb, dark thoughts<br></span>
<span class="i0">His only food? loaths he the touch of meat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And taste of wine? Thou fear’st, as I perceive,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some other snare, but idle is that fear, <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l460" id="BX_l460"></a>460</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For I have sworn the inviolable oath.<br></span>
<span class="i1">She ceas’d, to whom this answer I return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">How can I eat? what virtuous man and just,<br></span>
<span class="i0">O Circe! could endure the taste of wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or food, till he should see his prison’d friends<br></span>
<span class="i0">Once more at liberty? If then thy wish<br></span>
<span class="i0">That I should eat and drink be true, produce<br></span>
<span class="i0">My captive people; let us meet again.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So I; then Circe, bearing in her hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her potent rod, went forth, and op’ning wide <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l470" id="BX_l470"></a>470</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The door, drove out my people from the sty,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In bulk resembling brawns of the ninth year.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They stood before me; she through all the herd<br></span>
<span class="i0">Proceeding, with an unctuous antidote<br></span>
<span class="i0">Anointed each, and at the wholesome touch<br></span>
<span class="i0">All shed the swinish bristles by the drug<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dread Circe’s former magic gift, produced.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Restored at once to manhood, they appear’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">More vig’rous far, and sightlier than before.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They knew me, and with grasp affectionate <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l480" id="BX_l480"></a>480</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Hung on my hand. Tears follow’d, but of joy,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with loud cries the vaulted palace rang.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Even the awful Goddess felt, herself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Compassion, and, approaching me, began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Laertes’ noble son, for wiles renown’d!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hence to the shore, and to thy gallant bark;<br></span>
<span class="i0">First, hale her safe aground, then, hiding all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Your arms and treasures in the caverns, come<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thyself again, and hither lead thy friends.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So spake the Goddess, and my gen’rous mind <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l490" id="BX_l490"></a>490</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Persuaded; thence repairing to the beach,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I sought my ship; arrived, I found my crew<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lamenting miserably, and their cheeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">With tears bedewing ceaseless at her side.<br></span>
<span class="i0">As when the calves within some village rear’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, at eve, the herd returning home<br></span>
<span class="i0">From fruitful meads where they have grazed their fill,<br></span>
<span class="i0">No longer in the stalls contain’d, they rush<br></span>
<span class="i0">With many a frisk abroad, and, blaring oft,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With one consent, all dance their dams around, <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l500" id="BX_l500"></a>500</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">So they, at sight of me, dissolved in tears<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of rapt’rous joy, and each his spirit felt<br></span>
<span class="i0">With like affections warm’d as he had reach’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Just then his country, and his city seen,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fair Ithaca, where he was born and rear’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then in wing’d accents tender thus they spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Noble Ulysses! thy appearance fills<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our soul with transports, such as we should feel<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arrived in safety on our native shore.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Speak—say how perish’d our unhappy friends? <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l510" id="BX_l510"></a>510</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">So they; to whom this answer mild I gave.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hale we our vessel first ashore, and hide<br></span>
<span class="i0">In caverns all our treasures and our arms,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, hasting hence, follow me, and ere long<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ye shall behold your friends, beneath the roof<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Circe banqueting and drinking wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Abundant, for no dearth attends them there.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So I; whom all with readiness obey’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">All save Eurylochus; he sought alone<br></span>
<span class="i0">To stay the rest, and, eager, interposed. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l520" id="BX_l520"></a>520</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Ah whither tend we, miserable men?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Why covet ye this evil, to go down<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Circe’s palace? she will change us all<br></span>
<span class="i0">To lions, wolves or swine, that we may guard<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her palace, by necessity constrain’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So some were pris’ners of the Cyclops erst,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When, led by rash Ulysses, our lost friends<br></span>
<span class="i0">Intruded needlessly into his cave,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And perish’d by the folly of their Chief.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake, whom hearing, occupied I stood <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l530" id="BX_l530"></a>530</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In self-debate, whether, my faulchion keen<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forth-drawing from beside my sturdy thigh,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To tumble his lopp’d head into the dust,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Although he were my kinsman in the bonds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of close affinity; but all my friends<br></span>
<span class="i0">As with one voice, thus gently interposed.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Noble Ulysses! we will leave him here<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our vessel’s guard, if such be thy command,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But us lead thou to Circe’s dread abode.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, they left the galley, and set forth <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l540" id="BX_l540"></a>540</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Climbing the coast; nor would Eurylochus<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the hollow bark remain, but join’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">His comrades by my dreadful menace awed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the Goddess, busily employ’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bathed and refresh’d my friends with limpid oil,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And clothed them. We, arriving, found them all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Banqueting in the palace; there they met;<br></span>
<span class="i0">These ask’d, and those rehearsed the wond’rous tale,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, the recital made, all wept aloud<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till the wide dome resounded. Then approach’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l550" id="BX_l550"></a>550</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The graceful Goddess, and address’d me thus.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Laertes’ noble son, for wiles renown’d!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Provoke ye not each other, now, to tears.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I am not ignorant, myself, how dread<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have been your woes both on the fishy Deep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And on the land by force of hostile pow’rs.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But come—Eat now, and drink ye wine, that so<br></span>
<span class="i0">Your freshen’d spirit may revive, and ye<br></span>
<span class="i0">Courageous grow again, as when ye left<br></span>
<span class="i0">The rugged shores of Ithaca, your home. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l560" id="BX_l560"></a>560</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For now, through recollection, day by day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all your pains and toils, ye are become<br></span>
<span class="i0">Spiritless, strengthless, and the taste forget<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of pleasure, such have been your num’rous woes.<br></span>
<span class="i1">She spake, whose invitation kind prevail’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And won us to her will. There, then, we dwelt<br></span>
<span class="i0">The year complete, fed with delicious fare<br></span>
<span class="i0">Day after day, and quaffing gen’rous wine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when (the year fulfill’d) the circling hours<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their course resumed, and the successive months <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l570" id="BX_l570"></a>570</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With all their tedious days were spent, my friends,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Summoning me abroad, thus greeted me.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Sir! recollect thy country, if indeed<br></span>
<span class="i0">The fates ordain thee to revisit safe<br></span>
<span class="i0">That country, and thy own glorious abode.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So they; whose admonition I receiv’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Well-pleas’d. Then, all the day, regaled we sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">At Circe’s board with sav’ry viands rare,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And quaffing richest wine; but when, the sun<br></span>
<span class="i0">Declining, darkness overshadow’d all, <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l580" id="BX_l580"></a>580</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, each within the dusky palace took<br></span>
<span class="i0">Custom’d repose, and to the Goddess’ bed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Magnificent ascending, there I urged<br></span>
<span class="i0">My earnest suit, which gracious she receiv’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in wing’d accents earnest thus I spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">O Circe! let us prove thy promise true;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dismiss us hence. My own desires, at length,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tend homeward vehement, and the desires<br></span>
<span class="i0">No less of all my friends, who with complaints<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unheard by thee, wear my sad heart away. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l590" id="BX_l590"></a>590</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">So I; to whom the Goddess in return.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laertes’ noble son, Ulysses famed<br></span>
<span class="i0">For deepest wisdom! dwell not longer here,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou and thy followers, in my abode<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reluctant; but your next must be a course<br></span>
<span class="i0">Far diff’rent; hence departing, ye must seek<br></span>
<span class="i0">The dreary house of Ades and of dread<br></span>
<span class="i0">Persephone there to consult the Seer<br></span>
<span class="i0">Theban Tiresias, prophet blind, but blest<br></span>
<span class="i0">With faculties which death itself hath spared. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l600" id="BX_l600"></a>600</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To him alone, of all the dead, Hell’s Queen<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gives still to prophesy, while others flit<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mere forms, the shadows of what once they were.<br></span>
<span class="i1">She spake, and by her words dash’d from my soul<br></span>
<span class="i0">All courage; weeping on the bed I sat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reckless of life and of the light of day.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when, with tears and rolling to and fro<br></span>
<span class="i0">Satiate, I felt relief, thus I replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">O Circe! with what guide shall I perform<br></span>
<span class="i0">This voyage, unperform’d by living man? <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l610" id="BX_l610"></a>610</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">I spake, to whom the Goddess quick replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Brave Laertiades! let not the fear<br></span>
<span class="i0">To want a guide distress thee. Once on board,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Your mast erected, and your canvas white<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unfurl’d, sit thou; the breathing North shall waft<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy vessel on. But when ye shall have cross’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The broad expanse of Ocean, and shall reach<br></span>
<span class="i0">The oozy shore, where grow the poplar groves<br></span>
<span class="i0">And fruitless willows wan of Proserpine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Push thither through the gulphy Deep thy bark, <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l620" id="BX_l620"></a>620</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And, landing, haste to Pluto’s murky abode.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There, into Acheron runs not alone<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dread Pyriphlegethon, but Cocytus loud,<br></span>
<span class="i0">From Styx derived; there also stands a rock,<br></span>
<span class="i0">At whose broad base the roaring rivers meet.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There, thrusting, as I bid, thy bark ashore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">O Hero! scoop the soil, op’ning a trench<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ell-broad on ev’ry side; then pour around<br></span>
<span class="i0">Libation consecrate to all the dead,<br></span>
<span class="i0">First, milk with honey mixt, then luscious wine, <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l630" id="BX_l630"></a>630</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then water, sprinkling, last, meal over all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Next, supplicate the unsubstantial forms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fervently of the dead, vowing to slay,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Return’d to Ithaca) in thy own house,<br></span>
<span class="i0">An heifer barren yet, fairest and best<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all thy herds, and to enrich the pile<br></span>
<span class="i0">With delicacies such as please the shades;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, in peculiar, to Tiresias vow<br></span>
<span class="i0">A sable ram, noblest of all thy flocks.<br></span>
<span class="i0">When thus thou hast propitiated with pray’r <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l640" id="BX_l640"></a>640</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">All the illustrious nations of the dead,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Next, thou shalt sacrifice to them a ram<br></span>
<span class="i0">And sable ewe, turning the face of each<br></span>
<span class="i0">Right toward Erebus, and look thyself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, askance toward the river’s course.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Souls num’rous, soon, of the departed dead<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will thither flock; then, strenuous urge thy friends,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Flaying the victims which thy ruthless steel<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath slain, to burn them, and to sooth by pray’r<br></span>
<span class="i0">Illustrious Pluto and dread Proserpine. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l650" id="BX_l650"></a>650</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">While thus is done, thou seated at the foss,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Faulchion in hand, chace thence the airy forms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Afar, nor suffer them to approach the blood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till with Tiresias thou have first conferr’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, glorious Chief! the Prophet shall himself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Appear, who will instruct thee, and thy course<br></span>
<span class="i0">Delineate, measuring from place to place<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy whole return athwart the fishy flood.<br></span>
<span class="i1">While thus she spake, the golden dawn arose,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When, putting on me my attire, the nymph <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l660" id="BX_l660"></a>660</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Next, cloath’d herself, and girding to her waist<br></span>
<span class="i0">With an embroider’d zone her snowy robe<br></span>
<span class="i0">Graceful, redundant, veil’d her beauteous head.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, ranging the wide palace, I aroused<br></span>
<span class="i0">My followers, standing at the side of each—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Up! sleep no longer! let us quick depart,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For thus the Goddess hath, herself, advised.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So I, whose early summons my brave friends<br></span>
<span class="i0">With readiness obey’d. Yet even thence<br></span>
<span class="i0">I brought not all my crew. There was a youth, <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l670" id="BX_l670"></a>670</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Youngest of all my train, Elpenor; one<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not much in estimation for desert<br></span>
<span class="i0">In arms, nor prompt in understanding more,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who overcharged with wine, and covetous<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of cooler air, high on the palace-roof<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Circe slept, apart from all the rest.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Awaken’d by the clamour of his friends<br></span>
<span class="i0">Newly arisen, he also sprang to rise,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in his haste, forgetful where to find<br></span>
<span class="i0">The deep-descending stairs, plunged through the roof. <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l680" id="BX_l680"></a>680</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With neck-bone broken from the vertebræ<br></span>
<span class="i0">Outstretch’d he lay; his spirit sought the shades.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then, thus to my assembling friends I spake.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ye think, I doubt not, of an homeward course,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But Circe points me to the drear abode<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Proserpine and Pluto, to consult<br></span>
<span class="i0">The spirit of Tiresias, Theban seer.<br></span>
<span class="i1">I ended, and the hearts of all alike<br></span>
<span class="i0">Felt consternation; on the earth they sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Disconsolate, and plucking each his hair, <span class="linenum"><a name="BX_l690" id="BX_l690"></a>690</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet profit none of all their sorrow found.<br></span>
<span class="i1">But while we sought my galley on the beach<br></span>
<span class="i0">With tepid tears bedewing, as we went,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our cheeks, meantime the Goddess to the shore<br></span>
<span class="i0">Descending, bound within the bark a ram<br></span>
<span class="i0">And sable ewe, passing us unperceived.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For who hath eyes that can discern a God<br></span>
<span class="i0">Going or coming, if he shun the view?<br></span>

It is supposed by Eustathius that the pastures being
infested by gad flies and other noxious insects in the day-time, they
drove their sheep a-field in the morning, which by their wool were
defended from them, and their cattle in the evening, when the insects had
withdrawn. It is one of the few passages in Homer that must lie at the
mercy of conjecture.</p>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">Ulysses relates to Alcinoüs his voyage to the infernal regions, his
conference there with the prophet Tiresias concerning his return to
Ithaca, and gives him an account of the heroes, heroines, and others whom
he saw there.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Arriving on the shore, and launching, first,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our bark into the sacred Deep, we set<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our mast and sails, and stow’d secure on board<br></span>
<span class="i0">The ram and ewe, then, weeping, and with hearts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sad and disconsolate, embark’d ourselves.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now, melodious Circe, nymph divine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sent after us a canvas-stretching breeze,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pleasant companion of our course, and we<br></span>
<span class="i0">(The decks and benches clear’d) untoiling sat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">While managed gales sped swift the bark along. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXI_l10" id="BXI_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">All day, with sails distended, e’er the Deep<br></span>
<span class="i0">She flew, and when the sun, at length, declined,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And twilight dim had shadow’d all the ways,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Approach’d the bourn of Ocean’s vast profound.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The city, there, of the Cimmerians stands<br></span>
<span class="i0">With clouds and darkness veil’d, on whom the sun<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deigns not to look with his beam-darting eye,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or when he climbs the starry arch, or when<br></span>
<span class="i0">Earthward he slopes again his west’ring wheels,<a name="fnm_40" id="fnm_40"></a><a href="#fn_40" class="fnnum">40</a><br></span>

<span class="i0">We haled the bark aground, and, landing there<br></span>
<span class="i0">The ram and sable ewe, journey’d beside<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Deep, till we arrived where Circe bade.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here, Perimedes’ son Eurylochus<br></span>
<span class="i0">Held fast the destined sacrifice, while I<br></span>
<span class="i0">Scoop’d with my sword the soil, op’ning a trench<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ell-broad on ev’ry side, then pour’d around<br></span>
<span class="i0">Libation consecrate to all the dead,<br></span>

<span class="i0">This done, adoring the unreal forms<br></span>
<span class="i0">And shadows of the dead, I vow’d to slay,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Return’d to Ithaca) in my own abode,<br></span>
<span class="i0">An heifer barren yet, fairest and best<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all my herds, and to enrich the pile<br></span>
<span class="i0">With delicacies, such as please the shades.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, in peculiar, to the Theban seer<br></span>
<span class="i0">I vow’d a sable ram, largest and best<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all my flocks. When thus I had implored<br></span>
<span class="i0">With vows and pray’r, the nations of the dead, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXI_l40" id="BXI_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Piercing the victims next, I turn’d them both<br></span>

<span class="i0">From Erebus the shades of the deceased,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Brides, youths unwedded, seniors long with woe<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oppress’d, and tender girls yet new to grief.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Came also many a warrior by the spear<br></span>
<span class="i0">In battle pierced, with armour gore-distain’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And all the multitude around the foss<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stalk’d shrieking dreadful; me pale horror seized.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I next, importunate, my people urged, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXI_l50" id="BXI_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">To burn them, and to supplicate in pray’r<br></span>
<span class="i0">Illustrious Pluto and dread Proserpine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then down I sat, and with drawn faulchion chased<br></span>
<span class="i0">The ghosts, nor suffer’d them to approach the blood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till with Tiresias I should first confer.<br></span>
<span class="i1">The spirit, first, of my companion came,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Elpenor; for no burial honours yet<br></span>

<span class="i0">Ourselves by pressure urged of other cares.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Touch’d with compassion seeing him, I wept,<br></span>

<span class="i1">Elpenor! how cam’st thou into the realms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of darkness? Hast thou, though on foot, so far<br></span>
<span class="i0">Outstripp’d my speed, who in my bark arrived?<br></span>
<span class="i1">So I, to whom with tears he thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laertes’ noble son, for wiles renown’d!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fool’d by some dæmon and the intemp’rate bowl,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I perish’d in the house of Circe; there <span class="linenum"><a name="BXI_l70" id="BXI_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The deep-descending steps heedless I miss’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And fell precipitated from the roof.<br></span>
<span class="i0">With neck-bone broken from the vertebræ<br></span>
<span class="i0">Outstretch’d I lay; my spirit sought the shades.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But now, by those whom thou hast left at home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">By thy Penelope, and by thy fire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The gentle nourisher of thy infant growth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And by thy only son Telemachus<br></span>
<span class="i0">I make my suit to thee. For, sure, I know<br></span>
<span class="i0">That from the house of Pluto safe return’d, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXI_l80" id="BXI_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt ere long thy gallant vessel moor<br></span>
<span class="i0">At the Ææan isle. Ah! there arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">Remember me. Leave me not undeplored<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor uninhumed, lest, for my sake, the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">In vengeance visit thee; but with my arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">(What arms soe’er I left) burn me, and raise<br></span>
<span class="i0">A kind memorial of me on the coast,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heap’d high with earth; that an unhappy man<br></span>
<span class="i0">May yet enjoy an unforgotten name.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus do at my request, and on my hill <span class="linenum"><a name="BXI_l90" id="BXI_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Funereal, plant the oar with which I row’d,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Meantime discoursing me on various themes.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The soul of my departed mother, next,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Yet even her, (although it pain’d my soul)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forbad, relentless, to approach the blood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till with Tiresias I should first confer.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then came the spirit of the Theban seer<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself, his golden sceptre in his hand,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who knew me, and, enquiring, thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Why, hapless Chief! leaving the cheerful day, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXI_l110" id="BXI_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Arriv’st thou to behold the dead, and this<br></span>

<span class="i0">Receding, turn thy faulchion keen away,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That I may drink the blood, and tell thee truth.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake; I thence receding, deep infix’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">My sword bright-studded in the sheath again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The noble prophet then, approaching, drank<br></span>
<span class="i0">The blood, and, satisfied, address’d me thus.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thou seek’st a pleasant voyage home again,<br></span>

<span class="i0">That voyage difficult; for, as I judge,<br></span>

<span class="i0">That honour; him dismiss not, therefore, hence<br></span>
<span class="i0">With haste, nor from such indigence withhold<br></span>
<span class="i0">Supplies gratuitous; for ye are rich,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And by kind heav’n with rare possessions blest.<br></span>
<span class="i1">The Hero, next, Echeneus spake, a Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now ancient, eldest of Phæacia’s sons.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Your prudent Queen, my friends, speaks not beside<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her proper scope, but as beseems her well.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her voice obey; yet the effect of all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Must on Alcinoüs himself depend. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXI_l420" id="BXI_l420"></a>420</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Alcinoüs, thus, the King, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I ratify the word. So shall be done,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As surely as myself shall live supreme<br></span>
<span class="i0">O’er all Phæacia’s maritime domain.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then let the guest, though anxious to depart,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wait till the morrow, that I may complete<br></span>
<span class="i0">The whole donation. His safe conduct home<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall be the gen’ral care, but mine in Chief,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To whom dominion o’er the rest belongs.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d, then, Ulysses ever-wise. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXI_l430" id="BXI_l430"></a>430</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Alcinoüs! Prince! exalted high o’er all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Phæacia’s sons! should ye solicit, kind,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My stay throughout the year, preparing still<br></span>
<span class="i0">My conduct home, and with illustrious gifts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enriching me the while, ev’n that request<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should please me well; the wealthier I return’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The happier my condition; welcome more<br></span>
<span class="i0">And more respectable I should appear<br></span>
<span class="i0">In ev’ry eye to Ithaca restored.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Alcinoüs answer thus return’d. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXI_l440" id="BXI_l440"></a>440</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses! viewing thee, no fears we feel<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lest thou, at length, some false pretender prove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or subtle hypocrite, of whom no few<br></span>
<span class="i0">Disseminated o’er its face the earth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sustains, adepts in fiction, and who frame<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fables, where fables could be least surmised.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy phrase well turn’d, and thy ingenuous mind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Proclaim <i>thee</i> diff’rent far, who hast in strains<br></span>
<span class="i0">Musical as a poet’s voice, the woes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rehears’d of all thy Greecians, and thy own. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXI_l450" id="BXI_l450"></a>450</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But say, and tell me true. Beheld’st thou there<br></span>
<span class="i0">None of thy followers to the walls of Troy<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slain in that warfare? Lo! the night is long—<br></span>
<span class="i0">A night of utmost length; nor yet the hour<br></span>
<span class="i0">Invites to sleep. Tell me thy wond’rous deeds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For I could watch till sacred dawn, could’st thou<br></span>
<span class="i0">So long endure to tell me of thy toils.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then thus Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alcinoüs! high exalted over all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Phæacia’s sons! the time suffices yet <span class="linenum"><a name="BXI_l460" id="BXI_l460"></a>460</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For converse both and sleep, and if thou wish<br></span>

<span class="i0">More pitiable woes than these, sustain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">By my companions, in the end destroy’d;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, saved from perils of disast’rous war<br></span>
<span class="i0">At Ilium, perish’d yet in their return,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Victims of a pernicious woman’s crime.<a name="fnm_48" id="fnm_48"></a><a href="#fn_48" class="fnnum">48</a><br></span>
<span class="i1">Now, when chaste Proserpine had wide dispers’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Those female shades, the spirit sore distress’d<br></span>

<span class="i0">Encircled by a throng, he came; by all<br></span>

<span class="i0">Their fate fulfill’d, perishing by the sword.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He drank the blood, and knew me; shrill he wail’d<br></span>

<span class="i0">And with spread palms, through ardour of desire<br></span>
<span class="i0">He sought to enfold me fast, but vigour none,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or force, as erst, his agile limbs inform’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I, pity-moved, wept at the sight, and him,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In accents wing’d by friendship, thus address’d. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXI_l480" id="BXI_l480"></a>480</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Ah glorious son of Atreus, King of men!<br></span>
<span class="i0">What hand inflicted the all-numbing stroke<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of death on thee? Say, didst thou perish sunk<br></span>
<span class="i0">By howling tempests irresistible<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which Neptune raised, or on dry land by force<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of hostile multitudes, while cutting off<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beeves from the herd, or driving flocks away,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or fighting for Achaia’s daughters, shut<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within some city’s bulwarks close besieged?<br></span>
<span class="i1">I ceased, when Agamemnon thus replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXI_l490" id="BXI_l490"></a>490</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, noble Chief, Laertes’ son<br></span>

<span class="i0">But me Ægisthus slew; my woeful death<br></span>
<span class="i0">Confed’rate with my own pernicious wife<br></span>
<span class="i0">He plotted, with a show of love sincere<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bidding me to his board, where as the ox<br></span>

<span class="i0">Such was my dreadful death; carnage ensued<br></span>

<span class="i0">Num’rous as boars bright-tusk’d at nuptial feast,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Thou hast already witness’d many a field<br></span>

<span class="i0">But that dire scene had most thy pity moved,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For we, with brimming beakers at our side,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And underneath full tables bleeding lay.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Blood floated all the pavement. Then the cries <span class="linenum"><a name="BXI_l510" id="BXI_l510"></a>510</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Priam’s daughter sounded in my ears<br></span>
<span class="i0">Most pitiable of all. Cassandra’s cries,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Clytemnestra close beside me slew.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Expiring as I lay, I yet essay’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To grasp my faulchion, but the trayt’ress quick<br></span>

<span class="i0">My languid eyes, or prop my drooping chin<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ev’n in the moment when I sought the shades.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So that the thing breathes not, ruthless and fell<br></span>

<span class="i1">He ceas’d, to whom, thus, answer I return’d.<br></span>

<span class="i0">As nature bids; but me, my cruel one<br></span>

<span class="i0">My brother’s roof in Sparta’s wide domain?<br></span>
<span class="i0">For my Orestes is not yet a shade.<br></span>

<span class="i0">Semblances only of what once they were?<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake, to whom I, answ’ring, thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">O Peleus’ son! Achilles! bravest far<br></span>

<span class="i0">Seeking Tiresias, from his lips to learn,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Whom living we all honour’d as a God,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Achilles, causeless grief that thou hast died.<br></span>
<span class="i1">I ceased, and answer thus instant received.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Renown’d Ulysses! think not death a theme<br></span>

<span class="i0">But come—speak to me of my noble boy;<br></span>

This is surely one of the most natural strokes to be found
in any Poet. Convinced, for a moment, by the virtues of Penelope, he

crimes of Clytemnestra.</p>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">Ulysses, pursuing his narrative, relates his return from the shades to
Circe’s island, the precautions given him by that Goddess, his escape
from the Sirens, and from Scylla and Charybdis; his arrival in Sicily,
where his companions, having slain and eaten the oxen of the Sun, are
afterward shipwrecked and lost; and concludes the whole with an account
of his arrival, alone, on the mast of his vessel, at the island of
Calypso.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now, borne seaward from the river-stream<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Oceanus, we plow’d again<br></span>
<span class="i0">The spacious Deep, and reach’d th’ Ææan isle,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where, daughter of the dawn, Aurora takes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her choral sports, and whence the sun ascends.<br></span>
<span class="i0">We, there arriving, thrust our bark aground<br></span>
<span class="i0">On the smooth beach, then landed, and on shore<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reposed, expectant of the sacred dawn.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But soon as day-spring’s daughter rosy-palm’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Look’d forth again, sending my friends before, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l10" id="BXII_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I bade them bring Elpenor’s body down<br></span>
<span class="i0">From the abode of Circe to the beach.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, on the utmost headland of the coast<br></span>
<span class="i0">We timber fell’d, and, sorrowing o’er the dead,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His fun’ral rites water’d with tears profuse.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The dead consumed, and with the dead his arms,<br></span>
<span class="i0">We heap’d his tomb, and the sepulchral post<br></span>
<span class="i0">Erecting, fix’d his shapely oar aloft.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus, punctual, we perform’d; nor our return<br></span>
<span class="i0">From Ades knew not Circe, but attired <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l20" id="BXII_l20"></a>20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In haste, ere long arrived, with whom appear’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her female train with plenteous viands charged,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And bright wine rosy-red. Amidst us all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Standing, the beauteous Goddess thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ah miserable! who have sought the shades<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alive! while others of the human race<br></span>
<span class="i0">Die only once, appointed twice to die!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Come—take ye food; drink wine; and on the shore<br></span>
<span class="i0">All day regale, for ye shall hence again<br></span>
<span class="i0">At day-spring o’er the Deep; but I will mark <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l30" id="BXII_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself your future course, nor uninform’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Leave you in aught, lest, through some dire mistake,<br></span>
<span class="i0">By sea or land new mis’ries ye incur.<br></span>
<span class="i1">The Goddess spake, whose invitation kind<br></span>
<span class="i0">We glad accepted; thus we feasting sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till set of sun, and quaffing richest wine;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when the sun went down and darkness fell,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My crew beside the hawsers slept, while me<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Goddess by the hand leading apart,<br></span>
<span class="i0">First bade me sit, then, seated opposite, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l40" id="BXII_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Enquired, minute, of all that I had seen,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I, from first to last, recounted all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, thus the awful Goddess in return.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus far thy toils are finish’d. Now attend!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mark well my words, of which the Gods will sure<br></span>
<span class="i0">Themselves remind thee in the needful hour.<br></span>
<span class="i0">First shalt thou reach the Sirens; they the hearts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enchant of all who on their coast arrive.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The wretch, who unforewarn’d approaching, hears<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Sirens’ voice, his wife and little-ones <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l50" id="BXII_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ne’er fly to gratulate his glad return,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But him the Sirens sitting in the meads<br></span>
<span class="i0">Charm with mellifluous song, while all around<br></span>
<span class="i0">The bones accumulated lie of men<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now putrid, and the skins mould’ring away.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, pass them thou, and, lest thy people hear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Those warblings, ere thou yet approach, fill all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their ears with wax moulded between thy palms;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But as for thee—thou hear them if thou wilt.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet let thy people bind thee to the mast <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l60" id="BXII_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Erect, encompassing thy feet and arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">With cordage well-secured to the mast-foot,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So shalt thou, raptur’d, hear the Sirens’ song.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But if thou supplicate to be released,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or give such order, then, with added cords<br></span>
<span class="i0">Let thy companions bind thee still the more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">When thus thy people shall have safely pass’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Sirens by, think not from me to learn<br></span>
<span class="i0">What course thou next shalt steer; two will occur;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Delib’rate chuse; I shall describe them both. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l70" id="BXII_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Here vaulted rocks impend, dash’d by the waves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Immense of Amphitrite azure-eyed;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The blessed Gods those rocks, Erratic, call.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Birds cannot pass them safe; no, not the doves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which his ambrosia bear to Father Jove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But even of those doves the slipp’ry rock<br></span>
<span class="i0">Proves fatal still to one, for which the God<br></span>
<span class="i0">Supplies another, lest the number fail.<br></span>
<span class="i0">No ship, what ship soever there arrives,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Escapes them, but both mariners and planks <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l80" id="BXII_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Whelm’d under billows of the Deep, or, caught<br></span>
<span class="i0">By fiery tempests, sudden disappear.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Those rocks the billow-cleaving bark alone<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Argo, further’d by the vows of all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pass’d safely, sailing from Ææta’s isle;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor she had pass’d, but surely dash’d had been<br></span>
<span class="i0">On those huge rocks, but that, propitious still<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Jason, Juno sped her safe along.<br></span>
<span class="i0">These rocks are two; one lifts his summit sharp<br></span>
<span class="i0">High as the spacious heav’ns, wrapt in dun clouds <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l90" id="BXII_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Perpetual, which nor autumn sees dispers’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor summer, for the sun shines never there;<br></span>
<span class="i0">No mortal man might climb it or descend,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Though twice ten hands and twice ten feet he own’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For it is levigated as by art.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Down scoop’d to Erebus, a cavern drear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yawns in the centre of its western side;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pass it, renown’d Ulysses! but aloof<br></span>
<span class="i0">So far, that a keen arrow smartly sent<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from thy bark should fail to reach the cave. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l100" id="BXII_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">There Scylla dwells, and thence her howl is heard<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tremendous; shrill her voice is as the note<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of hound new-whelp’d, but hideous her aspect,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such as no mortal man, nor ev’n a God<br></span>
<span class="i0">Encount’ring her, should with delight survey.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her feet are twelve, all fore-feet; six her necks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of hideous length, each clubb’d into a head<br></span>
<span class="i0">Terrific, and each head with fangs is arm’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">In triple row, thick planted, stored with death.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Plunged to her middle in the hollow den <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l110" id="BXII_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">She lurks, protruding from the black abyss<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her heads, with which the rav’ning monster dives<br></span>
<span class="i0">In quest of dolphins, dog-fish, or of prey<br></span>
<span class="i0">More bulky, such as in the roaring gulphs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Amphitrite without end abounds.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It is no seaman’s boast that e’er he slipp’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her cavern by, unharm’d. In ev’ry mouth<br></span>
<span class="i0">She bears upcaught a mariner away.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The other rock, Ulysses, thou shalt find<br></span>
<span class="i0">Humbler, a bow-shot only from the first; <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l120" id="BXII_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">On this a wild fig grows broad-leav’d, and here<br></span>
<span class="i0">Charybdis dire ingulphs the sable flood.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Each day she thrice disgorges, and each day<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice swallows it. Ah! well forewarn’d, beware<br></span>
<span class="i0">What time she swallows, that thou come not nigh,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For not himself, Neptune, could snatch thee thence.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Close passing Scylla’s rock, shoot swift thy bark<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond it, since the loss of six alone<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is better far than shipwreck made of all.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So Circe spake, to whom I thus replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l130" id="BXII_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me, O Goddess, next, and tell me true!<br></span>
<span class="i0">If, chance, from fell Charybdis I escape,<br></span>
<span class="i0">May I not also save from Scylla’s force<br></span>
<span class="i0">My people; should the monster threaten them?<br></span>
<span class="i1">I said, and quick the Goddess in return.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unhappy! can exploits and toils of war<br></span>
<span class="i0">Still please thee? yield’st not to the Gods themselves?<br></span>
<span class="i0">She is no mortal, but a deathless pest,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Impracticable, savage, battle-proof.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Defence is vain; flight is thy sole resource. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l140" id="BXII_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For should’st thou linger putting on thy arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the rock, beware, lest darting forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her num’rous heads, she seize with ev’ry mouth<br></span>
<span class="i0">A Greecian, and with others, even thee.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pass therefore swift, and passing, loud invoke<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cratais, mother of this plague of man,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who will forbid her to assail thee more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, next, shalt reach Thrinacia; there, the beeves<br></span>
<span class="i0">And fatted flocks graze num’rous of the Sun;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sev’n herds; as many flocks of snowy fleece; <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l150" id="BXII_l150"></a>150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Fifty in each; they breed not, neither die,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor are they kept by less than Goddesses,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lampetia fair, and Phäethusa, both<br></span>
<span class="i0">By nymph Neæra to Hyperion borne.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Them, soon as she had train’d them to an age<br></span>
<span class="i0">Proportion’d to that charge, their mother sent<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into Thrinacia, there to dwell and keep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Inviolate their father’s flocks and herds.<br></span>
<span class="i0">If, anxious for a safe return, thou spare<br></span>
<span class="i0">Those herds and flocks, though after much endured, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l160" id="BXII_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ye may at last your Ithaca regain;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But should’st thou violate them, I foretell<br></span>
<span class="i0">Destruction of thy ship and of thy crew,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And though thyself escape, thou shalt return<br></span>
<span class="i0">Late, in ill plight, and all thy friends destroy’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">She ended, and the golden morning dawn’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, all-divine, her graceful steps she turn’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Back through the isle, and, at the beach arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I summon’d all my followers to ascend<br></span>
<span class="i0">The bark again, and cast the hawsers loose. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l170" id="BXII_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">They, at my voice, embarking, fill’d in ranks<br></span>
<span class="i0">The seats, and rowing, thresh’d the hoary flood.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now, melodious Circe, nymph divine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sent after us a canvas-stretching breeze,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pleasant companion of our course, and we<br></span>
<span class="i0">(The decks and benches clear’d) untoiling sat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">While managed gales sped swift the bark along.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, with dejected heart, thus I began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Oh friends! (for it is needful that not one<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or two alone the admonition hear <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l180" id="BXII_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Circe, beauteous prophetess divine)<br></span>
<span class="i0">To all I speak, that whether we escape<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or perish, all may be, at least, forewarn’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She bids us, first, avoid the dang’rous song<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the sweet Sirens and their flow’ry meads.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Me only she permits those strains to hear;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But ye shall bind me with coercion strong<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of cordage well-secured to the mast-foot,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And by no struggles to be loos’d of mine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But should I supplicate to be released <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l190" id="BXII_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Or give such order, then, with added cords<br></span>
<span class="i0">Be it your part to bind me still the more.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus with distinct precaution I prepared<br></span>
<span class="i0">My people; rapid in her course, meantime,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My gallant bark approach’d the Sirens’ isle,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For brisk and favourable blew the wind.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then fell the wind suddenly, and serene<br></span>
<span class="i0">A breathless calm ensued, while all around<br></span>
<span class="i0">The billows slumber’d, lull’d by pow’r divine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Up-sprang my people, and the folded sails <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l200" id="BXII_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Bestowing in the hold, sat to their oars,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which with their polish’d blades whiten’d the Deep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I, then, with edge of steel sev’ring minute<br></span>
<span class="i0">A waxen cake, chafed it and moulded it<br></span>
<span class="i0">Between my palms; ere long the ductile mass<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grew warm, obedient to that ceaseless force,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to Hyperion’s all-pervading beams.<br></span>
<span class="i0">With that soft liniment I fill’d the ears<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of my companions, man by man, and they<br></span>
<span class="i0">My feet and arms with strong coercion bound <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l210" id="BXII_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of cordage to the mast-foot well secured.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then down they sat, and, rowing, thresh’d the brine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when with rapid course we had arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within such distance as a voice may reach,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not unperceived by them the gliding bark<br></span>
<span class="i0">Approach’d, and, thus, harmonious they began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ulysses, Chief by ev’ry tongue extoll’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Achaia’s boast, oh hither steer thy bark!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here stay thy course, and listen to our lay!<br></span>
<span class="i0">These shores none passes in his sable ship <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l220" id="BXII_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Till, first, the warblings of our voice he hear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, happier hence and wiser he departs.<br></span>
<span class="i0">All that the Greeks endured, and all the ills<br></span>
<span class="i0">Inflicted by the Gods on Troy, we know,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Know all that passes on the boundless earth.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So they with voices sweet their music poured<br></span>
<span class="i0">Melodious on my ear, winning with ease<br></span>
<span class="i0">My heart’s desire to listen, and by signs<br></span>
<span class="i0">I bade my people, instant, set me free.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But they incumbent row’d, and from their seats <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l230" id="BXII_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Eurylochus and Perimedes sprang<br></span>
<span class="i0">With added cords to bind me still the more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">This danger past, and when the Sirens’ voice,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now left remote, had lost its pow’r to charm,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, my companions freeing from the wax<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their ears, deliver’d me from my restraint.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The island left afar, soon I discern’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Huge waves, and smoke, and horrid thund’rings heard.<br></span>
<span class="i0">All sat aghast; forth flew at once the oars<br></span>
<span class="i0">From ev’ry hand, and with a clash the waves <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l240" id="BXII_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Smote all together; check’d, the galley stood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">By billow-sweeping oars no longer urged,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I, throughout the bark, man after man<br></span>
<span class="i0">Encouraged all, addressing thus my crew.<br></span>
<span class="i1">We meet not, now, my friends, our first distress.<br></span>
<span class="i0">This evil is not greater than we found<br></span>
<span class="i0">When the huge Cyclops in his hollow den<br></span>
<span class="i0">Imprison’d us, yet even thence we ’scaped,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My intrepidity and fertile thought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Opening the way; and we shall recollect <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l250" id="BXII_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">These dangers also, in due time, with joy.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Come, then—pursue my counsel. Ye your seats<br></span>
<span class="i0">Still occupying, smite the furrow’d flood<br></span>
<span class="i0">With well-timed strokes, that by the will of Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">We may escape, perchance, this death, secure.<br></span>
<span class="i0">To thee the pilot thus I speak, (my words<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mark thou, for at thy touch the rudder moves)<br></span>
<span class="i0">This smoke, and these tumultuous waves avoid;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Steer wide of both; yet with an eye intent<br></span>
<span class="i0">On yonder rock, lest unaware thou hold <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l260" id="BXII_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Too near a course, and plunge us into harm.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So I; with whose advice all, quick, complied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But Scylla I as yet named not, (that woe<br></span>
<span class="i0">Without a cure) lest, terrified, my crew<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should all renounce their oars, and crowd below.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Just then, forgetful of the strict command<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Circe not to arm, I cloath’d me all<br></span>
<span class="i0">In radiant armour, grasp’d two quiv’ring spears,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to the deck ascended at the prow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Expecting earliest notice there, what time <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l270" id="BXII_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The rock-bred Scylla should annoy my friends.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But I discern’d her not, nor could, although<br></span>
<span class="i0">To weariness of sight the dusky rock<br></span>
<span class="i0">I vigilant explored. Thus, many a groan<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heaving, we navigated sad the streight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For here stood Scylla, while Charybdis there<br></span>
<span class="i0">With hoarse throat deep absorb’d the briny flood.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oft as she vomited the deluge forth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Like water cauldron’d o’er a furious fire<br></span>
<span class="i0">The whirling Deep all murmur’d, and the spray <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l280" id="BXII_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">On both those rocky summits fell in show’rs.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when she suck’d the salt wave down again,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, all the pool appear’d wheeling about<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within, the rock rebellow’d, and the sea<br></span>
<span class="i0">Drawn off into that gulph disclosed to view<br></span>
<span class="i0">The oozy bottom. Us pale horror seized.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, dreading death, with fast-set eyes we watch’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Charybdis; meantime, Scylla from the bark<br></span>
<span class="i0">Caught six away, the bravest of my friends.<br></span>
<span class="i0">With eyes, that moment, on my ship and crew <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l290" id="BXII_l290"></a>290</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Retorted, I beheld the legs and arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of those whom she uplifted in the air;<br></span>
<span class="i0">On me they call’d, my name, the last, last time<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pronouncing then, in agony of heart.<br></span>
<span class="i0">As when from some bold point among the rocks<br></span>
<span class="i0">The angler, with his taper rod in hand,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Casts forth his bait to snare the smaller fry,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He swings away remote his guarded line,<a name="fnm_56" id="fnm_56"></a><a href="#fn_56" class="fnnum">56</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then jerks his gasping prey forth from the Deep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So Scylla them raised gasping to the rock, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l300" id="BXII_l300"></a>300</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And at her cavern’s mouth devour’d them loud-<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shrieking, and stretching forth to me their arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">In sign of hopeless mis’ry. Ne’er beheld<br></span>
<span class="i0">These eyes in all the seas that I have roam’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A sight so piteous, nor in all my toils.<br></span>
<span class="i1">From Scylla and Charybdis dire escaped,<br></span>
<span class="i0">We reach’d the noble island of the Sun<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long, where bright Hyperion’s beauteous herds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Broad-fronted grazed, and his well-batten’d flocks.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I, in the bark and on the sea, the voice <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l310" id="BXII_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of oxen bellowing in hovels heard,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And of loud-bleating sheep; then dropp’d the word<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into my memory of the sightless Seer,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Theban Tiresias, and the caution strict<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Circe, my Ææan monitress,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who with such force had caution’d me to avoid<br></span>
<span class="i0">The island of the Sun, joy of mankind.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus then to my companions, sad, I spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Hear ye, my friends! although long time distress’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The words prophetic of the Theban seer <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l320" id="BXII_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And of Ææan Circe, whose advice<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was oft repeated to me to avoid<br></span>
<span class="i0">This island of the Sun, joy of mankind.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There, said the Goddess, dread your heaviest woes,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pass the isle, therefore, scudding swift away.<br></span>
<span class="i1">I ceased; they me with consternation heard,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And harshly thus Eurylochus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ulysses, ruthless Chief! no toils impair<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy strength, of senseless iron thou art form’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who thy companions weary and o’erwatch’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l330" id="BXII_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Forbidd’st to disembark on this fair isle,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where now, at last, we might with ease regale.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, rash, command’st us, leaving it afar,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To roam all night the Ocean’s dreary waste;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But winds to ships injurious spring by night,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And how shall we escape a dreadful death<br></span>
<span class="i0">If, chance, a sudden gust from South arise<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or stormy West, that dash in pieces oft<br></span>
<span class="i0">The vessel, even in the Gods’ despight?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Prepare we rather now, as night enjoins, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l340" id="BXII_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Our evening fare beside the sable bark,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In which at peep of day we may again<br></span>
<span class="i0">Launch forth secure into the boundless flood.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceas’d, whom all applauded. Then I knew<br></span>
<span class="i0">That sorrow by the will of adverse heav’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">Approach’d, and in wing’d accents thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">I suffer force, Eurylochus! and yield<br></span>
<span class="i0">O’er-ruled by numbers. Come, then, swear ye all<br></span>
<span class="i0">A solemn oath, that should we find an herd<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or num’rous flock, none here shall either sheep <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l350" id="BXII_l350"></a>350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Or bullock slay, by appetite profane<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seduced, but shall the viands eat content<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which from immortal Circe we received.<br></span>
<span class="i1">I spake; they readily a solemn oath<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sware all, and when their oath was fully sworn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within a creek where a fresh fountain rose<br></span>
<span class="i0">They moor’d the bark, and, issuing, began<br></span>
<span class="i0">Brisk preparation of their evening cheer.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when nor hunger now nor thirst remain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unsated, recollecting, then, their friends <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l360" id="BXII_l360"></a>360</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">By Scylla seized and at her cave devour’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They mourn’d, nor ceased to mourn them, till they slept.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The night’s third portion come, when now the stars<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had travers’d the mid-sky, cloud-gath’rer Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Call’d forth a vehement wind with tempest charged,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Menacing earth and sea with pitchy clouds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tremendous, and the night fell dark from heav’n.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when Aurora, daughter of the day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Look’d rosy forth, we haled, drawn inland more,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our bark into a grot, where nymphs were wont <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l370" id="BXII_l370"></a>370</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Graceful to tread the dance, or to repose.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Convening there my friends, I thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My friends! food fails us not, but bread is yet<br></span>
<span class="i0">And wine on board. Abstain we from the herds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lest harm ensue; for ye behold the flocks<br></span>
<span class="i0">And herds of a most potent God, the Sun!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose eye and watchful ear none may elude.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, I sway’d the gen’rous minds of all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">A month complete the South wind ceaseless blew,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor other wind blew next, save East and South, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l380" id="BXII_l380"></a>380</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet they, while neither food nor rosy wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fail’d them, the herds harm’d not, through fear to die.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, our provisions failing, they employed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whole days in search of food, snaring with hooks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Birds, fishes, of what kind soe’er they might.<br></span>
<span class="i0">By famine urged. I solitary roam’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the isle, seeking by pray’r to move<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some God to shew us a deliv’rance thence.<br></span>
<span class="i0">When, roving thus the isle, I had at length<br></span>
<span class="i0">Left all my crew remote, laving my hands <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l390" id="BXII_l390"></a>390</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Where shelter warm I found from the rude blast,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I supplicated ev’ry Pow’r above;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But they my pray’rs answer’d with slumbers soft<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shed o’er my eyes, and with pernicious art<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eurylochus, the while, my friends harangued.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My friends! afflicted as ye are, yet hear<br></span>
<span class="i0">A fellow-suff’rer. Death, however caused,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Abhorrence moves in miserable man,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But death by famine is a fate of all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Most to be fear’d. Come—let us hither drive <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l400" id="BXII_l400"></a>400</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And sacrifice to the Immortal Pow’rs<br></span>
<span class="i0">The best of all the oxen of the Sun,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Resolving thus—that soon as we shall reach<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our native Ithaca, we will erect<br></span>
<span class="i0">To bright Hyperion an illustrious fane,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which with magnificent and num’rous gifts<br></span>
<span class="i0">We will enrich. But should he chuse to sink<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our vessel, for his stately beeves incensed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And should, with him, all heav’n conspire our death,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I rather had with open mouth, at once, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l410" id="BXII_l410"></a>410</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Meeting the billows, perish, than by slow<br></span>
<span class="i0">And pining waste here in this desert isle.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake Eurylochus, whom all approved.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, driving all the fattest of the herd<br></span>
<span class="i0">Few paces only, (for the sacred beeves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grazed rarely distant from the bark) they stood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Compassing them around, and, grasping each<br></span>
<span class="i0">Green foliage newly pluck’d from saplings tall,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(For barley none in all our bark remain’d)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Worshipp’d the Gods in pray’r. Pray’r made, they slew<br></span>
<span class="i0">And flay’d them, and the thighs with double fat <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l421" id="BXII_l421"></a>421</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Investing, spread them o’er with slices crude.<br></span>
<span class="i0">No wine had they with which to consecrate<br></span>
<span class="i0">The blazing rites, but with libation poor<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of water hallow’d the interior parts.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now, when the thighs were burnt, and each had shared<br></span>
<span class="i0">His portion of the maw, and when the rest<br></span>
<span class="i0">All-slash’d and scored hung roasting at the fire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep, in that moment, suddenly my eyes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forsaking, to the shore I bent my way. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l430" id="BXII_l430"></a>430</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But ere the station of our bark I reach’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sav’ry steam greeted me. At the scent<br></span>
<span class="i0">I wept aloud, and to the Gods exclaim’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Oh Jupiter, and all ye Pow’rs above!<br></span>
<span class="i0">With cruel sleep and fatal ye have lull’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">My cares to rest, such horrible offence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime my rash companions have devised.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then, flew long-stoled Lampetia to the Sun<br></span>
<span class="i0">At once with tidings of his slaughter’d beeves,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he, incensed, the Immortals thus address’d. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l440" id="BXII_l440"></a>440</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Jove, and ye everlasting Pow’rs divine!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Avenge me instant on the crew profane<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Laertiades; Ulysses’ friends<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have dared to slay my beeves, which I with joy<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld, both when I climb’d the starry heav’ns,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And when to earth I sloped my “westring wheels,”<br></span>
<span class="i0">But if they yield me not amercement due<br></span>
<span class="i0">And honourable for my loss, to Hell<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will descend and give the ghosts my beams.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then, thus the cloud-assembler God replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l450" id="BXII_l450"></a>450</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Sun! shine thou still on the Immortal Pow’rs,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And on the teeming earth, frail man’s abode.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My candent bolts can in a moment reach<br></span>
<span class="i0">And split their flying bark in the mid-sea.<br></span>
<span class="i1">These things Calypso told me, taught, herself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">By herald Hermes, as she oft affirm’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">But when, descending to the shore, I reach’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">At length my bark, with aspect stern and tone<br></span>
<span class="i0">I reprimanded them, yet no redress<br></span>
<span class="i0">Could frame, or remedy—the beeves were dead. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l460" id="BXII_l460"></a>460</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Soon follow’d signs portentous sent from heav’n.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The skins all crept, and on the spits the flesh<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both roast and raw bellow’d, as with the voice<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of living beeves. Thus my devoted friends<br></span>
<span class="i0">Driving the fattest oxen of the Sun,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Feasted six days entire; but when the sev’nth<br></span>
<span class="i0">By mandate of Saturnian Jove appeared,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The storm then ceased to rage, and we, again<br></span>
<span class="i0">Embarking, launch’d our galley, rear’d the mast,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And gave our unfurl’d canvas to the wind. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l470" id="BXII_l470"></a>470</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">The island left afar, and other land<br></span>
<span class="i0">Appearing none, but sky alone and sea,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Right o’er the hollow bark Saturnian Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hung a cærulean cloud, dark’ning the Deep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not long my vessel ran, for, blowing wild,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now came shrill Zephyrus; a stormy gust<br></span>
<span class="i0">Snapp’d sheer the shrouds on both sides; backward fell<br></span>
<span class="i0">The mast, and with loose tackle strew’d the hold;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Striking the pilot in the stern, it crush’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">His scull together; he a diver’s plunge <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l480" id="BXII_l480"></a>480</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Made downward, and his noble spirit fled.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, Jove thund’ring, hurl’d into the ship<br></span>
<span class="i0">His bolts; she, smitten by the fires of Jove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Quaked all her length; with sulphur fill’d she reek’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And o’er her sides headlong my people plunged<br></span>
<span class="i0">Like sea-mews, interdicted by that stroke<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of wrath divine to hope their country more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But I, the vessel still paced to and fro,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till, fever’d by the boist’rous waves, her sides<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forsook the keel now left to float alone. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l490" id="BXII_l490"></a>490</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Snapp’d where it join’d the keel the mast had fall’n,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But fell encircled with a leathern brace,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which it retain’d; binding with this the mast<br></span>
<span class="i0">And keel together, on them both I sat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Borne helpless onward by the dreadful gale.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now the West subsided, and the South<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arose instead, with mis’ry charged for me,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That I might measure back my course again<br></span>
<span class="i0">To dire Charybdis. All night long I drove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And when the sun arose, at Scylla’s rock <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l500" id="BXII_l500"></a>500</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Once more, and at Charybdis’ gulph arrived.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It was the time when she absorb’d profound<br></span>
<span class="i0">The briny flood, but by a wave upborne<br></span>
<span class="i0">I seized the branches fast of the wild-fig.<a name="fnm_57" id="fnm_57"></a><a href="#fn_57" class="fnnum">57</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">To which, bat-like, I clung; yet where to fix<br></span>
<span class="i0">My foot secure found not, or where to ascend,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For distant lay the roots, and distant shot<br></span>
<span class="i0">The largest arms erect into the air,<br></span>
<span class="i0">O’ershadowing all Charybdis; therefore hard<br></span>
<span class="i0">I clench’d the boughs, till she disgorg’d again <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l510" id="BXII_l510"></a>510</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Both keel and mast. Not undesired by me<br></span>
<span class="i0">They came, though late; for at what hour the judge,<br></span>
<span class="i0">After decision made of num’rous strifes<a name="fnm_58" id="fnm_58"></a><a href="#fn_58" class="fnnum">58</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">Between young candidates for honour, leaves<br></span>
<span class="i0">The forum for refreshment’ sake at home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then was it that the mast and keel emerged.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deliver’d to a voluntary fall,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fast by those beams I dash’d into the flood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And seated on them both, with oary palms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Impell’d them; nor the Sire of Gods and men <span class="linenum"><a name="BXII_l520" id="BXII_l520"></a>520</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Permitted Scylla to discern me more,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Else had I perish’d by her fangs at last.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nine days I floated thence, and, on the tenth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dark night, the Gods convey’d me to the isle<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ogygia, habitation of divine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Calypso, by whose hospitable aid<br></span>
<span class="i0">And assiduity, my strength revived.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But wherefore this? ye have already learn’d<br></span>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">Ulysses, having finished his narrative, and received additional presents
from the Phæacians, embarks; he is conveyed in his sleep to Ithaca, and
in his sleep is landed on that island. The ship that carried him is in
her return transformed by Neptune to a rock.</p>

<p class="argumentcont">Minerva meets him on the shore, enables him to recollect his country,
which, till enlightened by her, he believed to be a country strange to
him, and they concert together the means of destroying the suitors. The
Goddess then repairs to Sparta to call thence Telemachus, and Ulysses, by
her aid disguised like a beggar, proceeds towards the cottage of Eumæus.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He ceas’d; the whole assembly silent sat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Charm’d into ecstacy with his discourse<br></span>
<span class="i0">Throughout the twilight hall. Then, thus the King.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ulysses, since beneath my brazen dome<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sublime thou hast arrived, like woes, I trust,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt not in thy voyage hence sustain<br></span>
<span class="i0">By tempests tost, though much to woe inured.<br></span>
<span class="i0">To you, who daily in my presence quaff<br></span>
<span class="i0">Your princely meed of gen’rous wine and hear<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sacred bard, my pleasure, thus I speak. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l10" id="BXIII_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The robes, wrought gold, and all the other gifts<br></span>
<span class="i0">To this our guest, by the Phæacian Chiefs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Brought hither in the sumptuous coffer lie.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But come—present ye to the stranger, each,<br></span>
<span class="i0">An ample tripod also, with a vase<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of smaller size, for which we will be paid<br></span>
<span class="i0">By public impost; for the charge of all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Excessive were by one alone defray’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake Alcinoüs, and his counsel pleased;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, all retiring, sought repose at home. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l20" id="BXIII_l20"></a>20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Look’d rosy forth, each hasted to the bark<br></span>
<span class="i0">With his illustrious present, which the might<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of King Alcinoüs, who himself her sides<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ascended, safe beneath the seats bestowed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lest it should harm or hinder, while he toil’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">In rowing, some Phæacian of the crew.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The palace of Alcinoüs seeking next,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Together, they prepared a new regale.<br></span>
<span class="i1">For them, in sacrifice, the sacred might<a name="fnm_59" id="fnm_59"></a><a href="#fn_59" class="fnnum">59</a> <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l30" id="BXIII_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of King Alcinoüs slew an ox to Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Saturnian, cloud-girt governor of all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The thighs with fire prepared, all glad partook<br></span>
<span class="i0">The noble feast; meantime, the bard divine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sang, sweet Demodocus, the people’s joy.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But oft Ulysses to the radiant sun<br></span>
<span class="i0">Turn’d wistful eyes, anxious for his decline,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor longer, now, patient of dull delay.<br></span>
<span class="i0">As when some hungry swain whose sable beeves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have through the fallow dragg’d his pond’rous plow <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l40" id="BXIII_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">All day, the setting sun views with delight<br></span>
<span class="i0">For supper’ sake, which with tir’d feet he seeks,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So welcome to Ulysses’ eyes appear’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sun-set of that eve; directing, then,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His speech to maritime Phæacia’s sons,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But to Alcinoüs chiefly, thus he said.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Alcinoüs, o’er Phæacia’s realm supreme!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Libation made, dismiss ye me in peace,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And farewell all! for what I wish’d, I have,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Conductors hence, and honourable gifts <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l50" id="BXIII_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With which heav’n prosper me! and may the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Vouchsafe to me, at my return, to find<br></span>
<span class="i0">All safe, my spotless consort and my friends!<br></span>
<span class="i0">May ye, whom here I leave, gladden your wives<br></span>
<span class="i0">And see your children blest, and may the pow’rs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Immortal with all good enrich you all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And from calamity preserve the land!<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, they unanimous, his speech<br></span>
<span class="i0">Applauded loud, and bade dismiss the guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who had so wisely spoken and so well. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l60" id="BXIII_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus Alcinoüs to his herald spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Pontonoüs! charging high the beaker, bear<br></span>
<span class="i0">To ev’ry guest beneath our roof the wine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That, pray’r preferr’d to the eternal Sire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">We may dismiss our inmate to his home.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then, bore Pontonoüs to ev’ry guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">The brimming cup; they, where they sat, perform’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Libation due; but the illustrious Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, from his seat arising, placed<br></span>
<span class="i0">A massy goblet in Areta’s hand, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l70" id="BXIII_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To whom in accents wing’d, grateful, he said.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Farewell, O Queen, a long farewell, till age<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arrive, and death, the appointed lot of all!<br></span>
<span class="i0">I go; but be this people, and the King<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alcinoüs, and thy progeny, thy joy<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet many a year beneath this glorious roof!<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, the Hero through the palace-gate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Issued, whom, by Alcinoüs’ command,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The royal herald to his vessel led.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Three maidens also of Areta’s train <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l80" id="BXIII_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His steps attended; one, the robe well-bleach’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">And tunic bore; the corded coffer, one;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And food the third, with wine of crimson hue.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arriving where the galley rode, each gave<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her charge to some brave mariner on board,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And all was safely stow’d. Meantime were spread<br></span>
<span class="i0">Linen and arras on the deck astern,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For his secure repose. And now the Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself embarking, silent lay’d him down.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, ev’ry rower to his bench repair’d; <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l90" id="BXIII_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">They drew the loosen’d cable from its hold<br></span>
<span class="i0">In the drill’d rock, and, resupine, at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">With lusty strokes upturn’d the flashing waves.<br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>His</i> eye-lids, soon, sleep, falling as a dew,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Closed fast, death’s simular, in sight the same.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She, as four harness’d stallions o’er the plain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shooting together at the scourge’s stroke,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Toss high their manes, and rapid scour along,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So mounted she the waves, while dark the flood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Roll’d after her of the resounding Deep. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l100" id="BXIII_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Steady she ran and safe, passing in speed<br></span>
<span class="i0">The falcon, swiftest of the fowls of heav’n;<br></span>
<span class="i0">With such rapidity she cut the waves,<br></span>
<span class="i0">An hero bearing like the Gods above<br></span>
<span class="i0">In wisdom, one familiar long with woe<br></span>
<span class="i0">In fight sustain’d, and on the perilous flood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Though sleeping now serenely, and resign’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To sweet oblivion of all sorrow past.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The brightest star of heav’n, precursor chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of day-spring, now arose, when at the isle <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l110" id="BXIII_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">(Her voyage soon perform’d) the bark arrived.<br></span>
<span class="i1">There is a port sacred in Ithaca<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Phorcys, hoary ancient of the Deep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Form’d by converging shores, prominent both<br></span>
<span class="i0">And both abrupt, which from the spacious bay<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exclude all boist’rous winds; within it, ships<br></span>
<span class="i0">(The port once gain’d) uncabled ride secure.<br></span>
<span class="i0">An olive, at the haven’s head, expands<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her branches wide, near to a pleasant cave<br></span>
<span class="i0">Umbrageous, to the nymphs devoted named <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l120" id="BXIII_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The Naiads. In that cave beakers of stone<br></span>
<span class="i0">And jars are seen; bees lodge their honey there;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And there, on slender spindles of the rock<br></span>
<span class="i0">The nymphs of rivers weave their wond’rous robes.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Perennial springs water it, and it shows<br></span>
<span class="i0">A twofold entrance; ingress one affords<br></span>
<span class="i0">To mortal man, which Northward looks direct,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But holier is the Southern far; by that<br></span>
<span class="i0">No mortal enters, but the Gods alone.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Familiar with that port before, they push’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l130" id="BXIII_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The vessel in; she, rapid, plow’d the sands<br></span>
<span class="i0">With half her keel, such rowers urged her on.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Descending from the well-bench’d bark ashore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They lifted forth Ulysses first, with all<br></span>
<span class="i0">His splendid couch complete, then, lay’d him down<br></span>
<span class="i0">Still wrapt in balmy slumber on the sands.<br></span>
<span class="i0">His treasures, next, by the Phæacian Chiefs<br></span>
<span class="i0">At his departure given him as the meed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Due to his wisdom, at the olive’s foot<br></span>
<span class="i0">They heap’d, without the road, lest, while he slept <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l140" id="BXIII_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Some passing traveller should rifle them.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then homeward thence they sped. Nor Ocean’s God<br></span>
<span class="i0">His threats forgot denounced against divine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, but with Jove thus first advised.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Eternal Sire! I shall no longer share<br></span>
<span class="i0">Respect and reverence among the Gods,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Since, now, Phæacia’s mortal race have ceas’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To honour me, though from myself derived.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It was my purpose, that by many an ill<br></span>
<span class="i0">Harass’d, Ulysses should have reach’d his home, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l150" id="BXIII_l150"></a>150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Although to intercept him, whose return<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thyself had promis’d, ne’er was my intent.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But him fast-sleeping swiftly o’er the waves<br></span>
<span class="i0">They have conducted, and have set him down<br></span>
<span class="i0">In Ithaca, with countless gifts enrich’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With brass, and tissued raiment, and with gold;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Much treasure! more than he had home convey’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Even had he arrived with all his share<br></span>
<span class="i0">Allotted to him of the spoils of Troy.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom the cloud-assembler God replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l160" id="BXIII_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">What hast thou spoken, Shaker of the shores,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wide-ruling Neptune? Fear not; thee the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will ne’er despise; dangerous were the deed<br></span>
<span class="i0">To cast dishonour on a God by birth<br></span>
<span class="i0">More ancient, and more potent far than they.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But if, profanely rash, a mortal man<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should dare to slight thee, to avenge the wrong<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some future day is ever in thy pow’r.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Accomplish all thy pleasure, thou art free.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d, then, the Shaker of the shores. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l170" id="BXIII_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Jove cloud-enthroned! that pleasure I would soon<br></span>
<span class="i0">Perform, as thou hast said, but that I watch<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy mind continual, fearful to offend.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My purpose is, now to destroy amid<br></span>
<span class="i0">The dreary Deep yon fair Phæacian bark,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Return’d from safe conveyance of her freight;<br></span>
<span class="i0">So shall they waft such wand’rers home no more,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And she shall hide their city, to a rock<br></span>
<span class="i0">Transform’d of mountainous o’ershadowing size.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him, then, Jove answer’d, gath’rer of the clouds. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l180" id="BXIII_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Perform it, O my brother, and the deed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus done, shall best be done—What time the people<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall from the city her approach descry,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fix her to stone transform’d, but still in shape<br></span>
<span class="i0">A gallant bark, near to the coast, that all<br></span>
<span class="i0">May wonder, seeing her transform’d to stone<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of size to hide their city from the view.<br></span>
<span class="i1">These words once heard, the Shaker of the shores<br></span>
<span class="i0">Instant to Scheria, maritime abode<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Phæacians, went. Arrived, he watch’d. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l190" id="BXIII_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And now the flying bark full near approach’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When Neptune, meeting her, with out-spread palm<br></span>
<span class="i0">Depress’d her at a stroke, and she became<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deep-rooted stone. Then Neptune went his way.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Phæacia’s ship-ennobled sons meantime<br></span>
<span class="i0">Conferring stood, and thus, in accents wing’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Th’ amazed spectator to his fellow spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ah! who hath sudden check’d the vessel’s course<br></span>
<span class="i0">Homeward? this moment she was all in view.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus they, unconscious of the cause, to whom <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l200" id="BXIII_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Alcinoüs, instructing them, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ye Gods! a prophecy now strikes my mind<br></span>
<span class="i0">With force, my father’s. He was wont to say—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Neptune resents it, that we safe conduct<br></span>
<span class="i0">Natives of ev’ry region to their home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He also spake, prophetic, of a day<br></span>
<span class="i0">When a Phæacian gallant bark, return’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">After conveyance of a stranger hence,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should perish in the dreary Deep, and changed<br></span>
<span class="i0">To a huge mountain, cover all the town. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l210" id="BXIII_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake my father, all whose words we see<br></span>
<span class="i0">This day fulfill’d. Thus, therefore, act we all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unanimous; henceforth no longer bear<br></span>
<span class="i0">The stranger home, when such shall here arrive;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And we will sacrifice, without delay,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Twelve chosen bulls to Neptune, if, perchance,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He will commiserate us, and forbear<br></span>
<span class="i0">To hide our town behind a mountain’s height.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake, they, terrified, the bulls prepared.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus all Phæacia’s Senators and Chiefs <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l220" id="BXIII_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His altar compassing, in pray’r adored<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Ocean’s God. Meantime, Ulysses woke,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unconscious where; stretch’d on his native soil<br></span>
<span class="i0">He lay, and knew it not, long-time exiled.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For Pallas, progeny of Jove, a cloud<br></span>
<span class="i0">Drew dense around him, that, ere yet agnized<br></span>
<span class="i0">By others, he might wisdom learn from her,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Neither to citizens, nor yet to friends<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reveal’d, nor even to his own espoused,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till, first, he should avenge complete his wrongs <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l230" id="BXIII_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Domestic from those suitors proud sustained.<br></span>
<span class="i0">All objects, therefore, in the Hero’s eyes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seem’d alien, foot-paths long, commodious ports,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heav’n-climbing rocks, and trees of amplest growth.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arising, fixt he stood, his native soil<br></span>
<span class="i0">Contemplating, till with expanded palms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both thighs he smote, and, plaintive, thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ah me! what mortal race inhabits here?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rude are they, contumacious and unjust,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or hospitable, and who fear the Gods? <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l240" id="BXIII_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Where now shall I secrete these num’rous stores?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where wander I, myself? I would that still<br></span>
<span class="i0">Phæacians own’d them, and I had arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">In the dominions of some other King<br></span>
<span class="i0">Magnanimous, who would have entertain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">And sent me to my native home secure!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now, neither know I where to place my wealth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor can I leave it here, lest it become<br></span>
<span class="i0">Another’s prey. Alas! Phæacia’s Chiefs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not altogether wise I deem or just, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l250" id="BXIII_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Who have misplaced me in another land,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Promis’d to bear me to the pleasant shores<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ithaca, but have not so perform’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Jove, guardian of the suppliant’s rights, who all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Transgressors marks, and punishes all wrong,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Avenge me on the treach’rous race!—but hold—<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will revise my stores, so shall I know<br></span>
<span class="i0">If they have left me here of aught despoiled.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he number’d carefully the gold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The vases, tripods bright, and tissued robes, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l260" id="BXIII_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But nothing miss’d of all. Then he bewail’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">His native isle, with pensive steps and slow<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pacing the border of the billowy flood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forlorn; but while he wept, Pallas approach’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In form a shepherd stripling, girlish fair<br></span>
<span class="i0">In feature, such as are the sons of Kings;<br></span>
<span class="i0">A sumptuous mantle o’er his shoulders hung<br></span>
<span class="i0">Twice-folded, sandals his nice feet upbore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And a smooth javelin glitter’d in his hand.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, joyful at the sight, his steps <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l270" id="BXIII_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Turn’d brisk toward her, whom he thus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Sweet youth! since thee, of all mankind, I first<br></span>
<span class="i0">Encounter in this land unknown, all hail!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Come not with purposes of harm to me!<br></span>
<span class="i0">These save, and save me also. I prefer<br></span>
<span class="i0">To thee, as to some God, my pray’r, and clasp<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy knees a suppliant. Say, and tell me true,<br></span>
<span class="i0">What land? what people? who inhabit here?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is this some isle delightful, or a shore<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of fruitful main-land sloping to the sea? <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l280" id="BXIII_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Then Pallas, thus, Goddess cærulean-eyed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stranger! thou sure art simple, or hast dwelt<br></span>
<span class="i0">Far distant hence, if of this land thou ask.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It is not, trust me, of so little note,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But known to many, both to those who dwell<br></span>
<span class="i0">Toward the sun-rise, and to others placed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Behind it, distant in the dusky West.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rugged it is, not yielding level course<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the swift steed, and yet no barren spot,<br></span>
<span class="i0">However small, but rich in wheat and wine; <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l290" id="BXIII_l290"></a>290</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor wants it rain or fertilising dew,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But pasture green to goats and beeves affords,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Trees of all kinds, and fountains never dry.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ithaca therefore, stranger, is a name<br></span>
<span class="i0">Known ev’n at Troy, a city, by report,<br></span>
<span class="i0">At no small distance from Achaia’s shore.<br></span>
<span class="i1">The Goddess ceased; then, toil-enduring Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, happy in his native land,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(So taught by Pallas, progeny of Jove)<br></span>
<span class="i0">In accents wing’d her answ’ring, utter’d prompt <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l300" id="BXIII_l300"></a>300</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Not truth, but figments to truth opposite,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For guile, in him, stood never at a pause.<br></span>
<span class="i1">O’er yonder flood, even in spacious Crete<a name="fnm_60" id="fnm_60"></a><a href="#fn_60" class="fnnum">60</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">I heard of Ithaca, where now, it seems,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I have, myself, with these my stores arrived;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not richer stores than, flying thence, I left<br></span>
<span class="i0">To my own children; for from Crete I fled<br></span>
<span class="i0">For slaughter of Orsilochus the swift,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Son of Idomeneus, whom none in speed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Could equal throughout all that spacious isle. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l310" id="BXIII_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His purpose was to plunder me of all<br></span>
<span class="i0">My Trojan spoils, which to obtain, much woe<br></span>
<span class="i0">I had in battle and by storms endured,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For that I would not gratify his Sire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fighting beside him in the fields of Troy,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But led a diff’rent band. Him from the field<br></span>
<span class="i0">Returning homeward, with my brazen spear<br></span>
<span class="i0">I smote, in ambush waiting his return<br></span>
<span class="i0">At the road-side, with a confed’rate friend.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unwonted darkness over all the heav’ns <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l320" id="BXIII_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That night prevailed, nor any eye of man<br></span>
<span class="i0">Observed us, but, unseen, I slew the youth.<br></span>
<span class="i0">No sooner, then, with my sharp spear of life<br></span>
<span class="i0">I had bereft him, than I sought a ship<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mann’d by renown’d Phæacians, whom with gifts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Part of my spoils, and by requests, I won.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I bade them land me on the Pylian shore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or in fair Elis by th’ Epeans ruled,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But they, reluctant, were by violent winds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Driv’n devious thence, for fraud they purposed none. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l330" id="BXIII_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus through constraint we here arrived by night,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with much difficulty push’d the ship<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into safe harbour, nor was mention made<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of food by any, though all needed food,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, disembark’d in haste, on shore we lay.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I, weary, slept profound, and they my goods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forth heaving from the bark, beside me placed<br></span>
<span class="i0">The treasures on the sea-beach where I slept,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, reimbarking, to the populous coast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Steer’d of Sidonia, and me left forlorn. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l340" id="BXIII_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceased; then smiled Minerva azure-eyed<br></span>
<span class="i0">And stroaked his cheek, in form a woman now,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beauteous, majestic, in all elegant arts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Accomplish’d, and with accents wing’d replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Who passes thee in artifice well-framed<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in imposture various, need shall find<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all his policy, although a God.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Canst thou not cease, inventive as thou art<br></span>
<span class="i0">And subtle, from the wiles which thou hast lov’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Since thou wast infant, and from tricks of speech <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l350" id="BXIII_l350"></a>350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Delusive, even in thy native land?<br></span>
<span class="i0">But come, dismiss we these ingenious shifts<br></span>
<span class="i0">From our discourse, in which we both excel;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For thou of all men in expedients most<br></span>
<span class="i0">Abound’st and eloquence, and I, throughout<br></span>
<span class="i0">All heav’n have praise for wisdom and for art.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And know’st thou not thine Athenæan aid,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pallas, Jove’s daughter, who in all thy toils<br></span>
<span class="i0">Assist thee and defend? I gave thee pow’r<br></span>

<span class="i0">And here arrive ev’n now, counsels to frame<br></span>
<span class="i0">Discrete with thee, and to conceal the stores<br></span>
<span class="i0">Giv’n to thee by the rich Phæacian Chiefs<br></span>
<span class="i0">On my suggestion, at thy going thence.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will inform thee also what distress<br></span>
<span class="i0">And hardship under thy own palace-roof<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou must endure; which, since constraint enjoins,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bear patiently, and neither man apprize<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor woman that thou hast arrived forlorn<br></span>
<span class="i0">And vagabond, but silent undergo <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l370" id="BXIII_l370"></a>370</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">What wrongs soever from the hands of men.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">O Goddess! thou art able to elude,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wherever met, the keenest eye of man,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For thou all shapes assum’st; yet this I know<br></span>
<span class="i0">Certainly, that I ever found thee kind,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Long as Achaia’s Heroes fought at Troy;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when (the lofty tow’rs of Priam laid<br></span>
<span class="i0">In dust) we re-embark’d, and by the will<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of heav’n Achaia’s fleet was scatter’d wide, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l380" id="BXIII_l380"></a>380</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thenceforth, O daughter wise of Jove, I thee<br></span>
<span class="i0">Saw not, nor thy appearance in my ship<br></span>
<span class="i0">Once mark’d, to rid me of my num’rous woes,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But always bearing in my breast a heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">With anguish riv’n, I roam’d, till by the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Relieved at length, and till with gracious words<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thyself didst in Phæacia’s opulent land<br></span>
<span class="i0">Confirm my courage, and becam’st my guide.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But I adjure thee in thy father’s name—<br></span>
<span class="i0">O tell me truly, (for I cannot hope <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l390" id="BXIII_l390"></a>390</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That I have reach’d fair Ithaca; I tread<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some other soil, and thou affirm’st it mine<br></span>
<span class="i0">To mock me merely, and deceive) oh say—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Am I in Ithaca? in truth, at home?<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus then Minerva the cærulean-eyed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such caution in thy breast always prevails<br></span>
<span class="i0">Distrustful; but I know thee eloquent,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With wisdom and with ready thought endued,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And cannot leave thee, therefore, thus distress’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">For what man, save Ulysses, new-return’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l400" id="BXIII_l400"></a>400</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">After long wand’rings, would not pant to see<br></span>
<span class="i0">At once his home, his children, and his wife?<br></span>
<span class="i0">But thou preferr’st neither to know nor ask<br></span>
<span class="i0">Concerning them, till some experience first<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou make of her whose wasted youth is spent<br></span>
<span class="i0">In barren solitude, and who in tears<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ceaseless her nights and woeful days consumes.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I ne’er was ignorant, but well foreknew<br></span>
<span class="i0">That not till after loss of all thy friends<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou should’st return; but loth I was to oppose <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l410" id="BXIII_l410"></a>410</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Neptune, my father’s brother, sore incensed<br></span>
<span class="i0">For his son’s sake deprived of sight by thee.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, I will give thee proof—come now—survey<br></span>
<span class="i0">These marks of Ithaca, and be convinced.<br></span>
<span class="i1">This is the port of Phorcys, sea-born sage;<br></span>
<span class="i0">That, the huge olive at the haven’s head;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fast by it, thou behold’st the pleasant cove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Umbrageous, to the nymphs devoted named<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Naiads; this the broad-arch’d cavern is<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where thou wast wont to offer to the nymphs <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l420" id="BXIII_l420"></a>420</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Many a whole hecatomb; and yonder stands<br></span>
<span class="i0">The mountain Neritus with forests cloath’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, the Goddess scatter’d from before<br></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes all darkness, and he knew the land.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then felt Ulysses, Hero toil-inured,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Transport unutterable, seeing plain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Once more his native isle. He kiss’d the glebe,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with uplifted hands the nymphs ador’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Nymphs, Naiads, Jove’s own daughters! I despair’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To see you more, whom yet with happy vows <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l430" id="BXIII_l430"></a>430</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I now can hail again. Gifts, as of old,<br></span>
<span class="i0">We will hereafter at your shrines present,<br></span>
<span class="i0">If Jove-born Pallas, huntress of the spoils,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grant life to me, and manhood to my son.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then Pallas, blue-eyed progeny of Jove.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Take courage; trouble not thy mind with thoughts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now needless. Haste—delay not—far within<br></span>
<span class="i0">This hallow’d cave’s recess place we at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy precious stores, that they may thine remain,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then muse together on thy wisest course. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l440" id="BXIII_l440"></a>440</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, the Goddess enter’d deep the cave<br></span>
<span class="i0">Caliginous, and its secret nooks explored<br></span>
<span class="i0">From side to side; meantime, Ulysses brought<br></span>
<span class="i0">All his stores into it, the gold, the brass,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And robes magnificent, his gifts received<br></span>

<span class="i0">And Pallas, daughter of Jove Ægis-arm’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Closed fast, herself, the cavern with a stone.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then, on the consecrated olive’s root<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both seated, they in consultation plann’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l450" id="BXIII_l450"></a>450</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The deaths of those injurious suitors proud,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Pallas, blue-eyed Goddess, thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Laertes’ noble son, Ulysses! think<br></span>
<span class="i0">By what means likeliest thou shalt assail<br></span>
<span class="i0">Those shameless suitors, who have now controuled<br></span>
<span class="i0">Three years thy family, thy matchless wife<br></span>
<span class="i0">With language amorous and with spousal gifts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Urging importunate; but she, with tears<br></span>
<span class="i0">Watching thy wish’d return, hope gives to all<br></span>
<span class="i0">By messages of promise sent to each, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l460" id="BXIII_l460"></a>460</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Framing far other purposes the while.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer thus Ulysses wise return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, Agamemnon’s miserable fate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had surely met me in my own abode,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But for thy gracious warning, pow’r divine!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Come then—Devise the means; teach me, thyself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The way to vengeance, and my soul inspire<br></span>
<span class="i0">With daring fortitude, as when we loos’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her radiant frontlet from the brows of Troy.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Would’st thou with equal zeal, O Pallas! aid <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l470" id="BXIII_l470"></a>470</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy servant here, I would encounter thrice<br></span>
<span class="i0">An hundred enemies, let me but perceive<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy dread divinity my prompt ally.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d then Pallas cærulean-eyed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And such I will be; not unmark’d by me,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Let once our time of enterprize arrive)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shalt thou assail them. Many, as I judge,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of those proud suitors who devour thy wealth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall leave their brains, then, on thy palace floor.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But come. Behold! I will disguise thee so <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l480" id="BXIII_l480"></a>480</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That none shall know thee! I will parch the skin<br></span>
<span class="i0">On thy fair body; I will cause thee shed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy wavy locks; I will enfold thee round<br></span>
<span class="i0">In such a kirtle as the eyes of all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall loath to look on; and I will deform<br></span>
<span class="i0">With blurring rheums thy eyes, so vivid erst;<br></span>
<span class="i0">So shall the suitors deem thee, and thy wife,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thy own son whom thou didst leave at home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some sordid wretch obscure. But seek thou first<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy swine-herd’s mansion; he, alike, intends <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l490" id="BXIII_l490"></a>490</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy good, and loves, affectionate, thy son<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thy Penelope; thou shalt find the swain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tending his herd; they feed beneath the rock<br></span>
<span class="i0">Corax, at side of Arethusa’s fount,<br></span>
<span class="i0">On acorns dieted, nutritious food<br></span>
<span class="i0">To them, and drinking of the limpid stream.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There waiting, question him of thy concerns,<br></span>
<span class="i0">While I from Sparta praised for women fair<br></span>
<span class="i0">Call home thy son Telemachus, a guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">With Menelaus now, whom to consult <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l500" id="BXIII_l500"></a>500</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In spacious Lacedæmon he is gone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Anxious to learn if yet his father lives.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And why, alas! all-knowing as thou art,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Him left’st thou ignorant? was it that he,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He also, wand’ring wide the barren Deep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Might suffer woe, while these devour his wealth?<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d then Pallas cærulean-eyed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grieve thou not much for him. I sent him forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself, that there arrived, he might acquire <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l510" id="BXIII_l510"></a>510</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Honour and fame. No suff’rings finds he there,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But in Atrides’ palace safe resides,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enjoying all abundance. Him, in truth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors watch close ambush’d on the Deep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Intent to slay him ere he reach his home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But shall not as I judge, till of themselves<br></span>
<span class="i0">The earth hide some who make thee, now, a prey.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, the Goddess touch’d him with a wand.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At once o’er all his agile limbs she parch’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The polish’d skin; she wither’d to the root <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l520" id="BXIII_l520"></a>520</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His wavy locks; and cloath’d him with the hide<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deform’d of wrinkled age; she charged with rheums<br></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes before so vivid, and a cloak<br></span>
<span class="i0">And kirtle gave him, tatter’d, both, and foul,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And smutch’d with smoak; then, casting over all<br></span>
<span class="i0">An huge old deer-skin bald, with a long staff<br></span>
<span class="i0">She furnish’d him, and with a wallet patch’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">On all sides, dangling by a twisted thong.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus all their plan adjusted, diff’rent ways<br></span>
<span class="i0">They took, and she, seeking Ulysses’ son, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIII_l530" id="BXIII_l530"></a>530</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To Lacedæmon’s spacious realm repair’d.<br></span>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">Ulysses arriving at the house of Eumæus, is hospitably entertained, and
spends the night there.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Leaving the haven-side, he turn’d his steps<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into a rugged path, which over hills<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mantled with trees led him to the abode<br></span>
<span class="i0">By Pallas mention’d of his noble friend<a name="fnm_61" id="fnm_61"></a><a href="#fn_61" class="fnnum">61</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">The swine-herd, who of all Ulysses’ train<br></span>
<span class="i0">Watch’d with most diligence his rural stores.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Him sitting in the vestibule he found<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of his own airy lodge commodious, built<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst a level lawn. That structure neat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eumæus, in the absence of his Lord, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l10" id="BXIV_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Had raised, himself, with stones from quarries hewn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unaided by Laertes or the Queen.<br></span>
<span class="i0">With tangled thorns he fenced it safe around,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with contiguous stakes riv’n from the trunks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of solid oak black-grain’d hemm’d it without.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Twelve penns he made within, all side by side,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lairs for his swine, and fast-immured in each<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lay fifty pregnant females on the floor.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The males all slept without, less num’rous far,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thinn’d by the princely wooers at their feasts <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l20" id="BXIV_l20"></a>20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Continual, for to them he ever sent<br></span>
<span class="i0">The fattest of his saginated charge.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Three hundred, still, and sixty brawns remained.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Four mastiffs in adjoining kennels lay,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Resembling wild-beasts nourish’d at the board<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the illustrious steward of the styes.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself sat fitting sandals to his feet,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Carved from a stain’d ox-hide. Four hinds he kept,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now busied here and there; three in the penns<br></span>
<span class="i0">Were occupied; meantime, the fourth had sought <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l30" id="BXIV_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The city, whither, for the suitors’ use,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With no good will, but by constraint, he drove<br></span>
<span class="i0">A boar, that, sacrificing to the Gods,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Th’ imperious guests might on his flesh regale.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Soon as those clamorous watch-dogs the approach<br></span>
<span class="i0">Saw of Ulysses, baying loud, they ran<br></span>
<span class="i0">Toward him; he, as ever, well-advised,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Squatted, and let his staff fall from his hand.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet foul indignity he had endured<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ev’n there, at his own farm, but that the swain, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l40" id="BXIV_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Following his dogs in haste, sprang through the porch<br></span>
<span class="i0">To his assistance, letting fall the hide.<br></span>
<span class="i0">With chiding voice and vollied stones he soon<br></span>
<span class="i0">Drove them apart, and thus his Lord bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Old man! one moment more, and these my dogs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had, past doubt, worried thee, who should’st have proved,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So slain, a source of obloquy to me.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But other pangs the Gods, and other woes<br></span>
<span class="i0">To me have giv’n, who here lamenting sit<br></span>
<span class="i0">My godlike master, and his fatted swine <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l50" id="BXIV_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Nourish for others’ use, while he, perchance,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A wand’rer in some foreign city, seeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fit sustenance, and none obtains, if still<br></span>
<span class="i0">Indeed he live, and view the light of day.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, old friend! follow me into the house,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That thou, at least, with plenteous food refresh’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And cheer’d with wine sufficient, may’st disclose<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both who thou art, and all that thou hast borne.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, the gen’rous swine-herd introduced<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, and thick bundles spread of twigs <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l60" id="BXIV_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath him, cover’d with the shaggy skin<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of a wild goat, of which he made his couch<br></span>
<span class="i0">Easy and large; the Hero, so received,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rejoiced, and thus his gratitude express’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Jove grant thee and the Gods above, my host,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For such beneficence thy chief desire!<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My guest! I should offend, treating with scorn<br></span>
<span class="i0">The stranger, though a poorer should arrive<br></span>
<span class="i0">Than ev’n thyself; for all the poor that are, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l70" id="BXIV_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And all the strangers are the care of Jove.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Little, and with good will, is all that lies<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within my scope; no man can much expect<br></span>
<span class="i0">From servants living in continual fear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Under young masters; for the Gods, no doubt,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have intercepted my own Lord’s return,<br></span>
<span class="i0">From whom great kindness I had, else, received,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With such a recompense as servants gain<br></span>
<span class="i0">From gen’rous masters, house and competence,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And lovely wife from many a wooer won, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l80" id="BXIV_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose industry should have requited well<br></span>
<span class="i0">His goodness, with such blessing from the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">As now attends me in my present charge.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Much had I, therefore, prosper’d, had my Lord<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grown old at home; but he hath died—I would<br></span>
<span class="i0">That the whole house of Helen, one and all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Might perish too, for she hath many slain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, like my master, went glory to win<br></span>
<span class="i0">For Agamemnon in the fields of Troy.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he girdled, quick, his tunic close, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l90" id="BXIV_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And, issuing, sought the styes; thence bringing two<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the imprison’d herd, he slaughter’d both,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Singed them, and slash’d and spitted them, and placed<br></span>
<span class="i0">The whole well-roasted banquet, spits and all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reeking before Ulysses; last, with flour<br></span>
<span class="i0">He sprinkled them, and filling with rich wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">His ivy goblet, to his master sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Opposite, whom inviting thus he said.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Now, eat, my guest! such as a servant may<br></span>
<span class="i0">I set before thee, neither large of growth <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l100" id="BXIV_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor fat; the fatted—those the suitors eat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fearless of heav’n, and pitiless of man.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet deeds unjust as theirs the blessed Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Love not; they honour equity and right.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Even an hostile band when they invade<br></span>
<span class="i0">A foreign shore, which by consent of Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">They plunder, and with laden ships depart,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Even they with terrours quake of wrath divine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But these are wiser; these must sure have learn’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">From some true oracle my master’s death, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l110" id="BXIV_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Who neither deign with decency to woo,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet to seek their homes, but boldly waste<br></span>
<span class="i0">His substance, shameless, now, and sparing nought.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Jove ne’er hath giv’n us yet the night or day<br></span>
<span class="i0">When with a single victim, or with two<br></span>
<span class="i0">They would content them, and his empty jars<br></span>
<span class="i0">Witness how fast the squand’rers use his wine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Time was, when he was rich indeed; such wealth<br></span>
<span class="i0">No Hero own’d on yonder continent,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet in Ithaca; no twenty Chiefs <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l120" id="BXIV_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Could match with all their treasures his alone;<br></span>
<span class="i0">I tell thee their amount. Twelve herds of his<br></span>
<span class="i0">The mainland graze;<a name="fnm_62" id="fnm_62"></a><a href="#fn_62" class="fnnum">62</a> as many flocks of sheep;<br></span>
<span class="i0">As many droves of swine; and hirelings there<br></span>
<span class="i0">And servants of his own seed for his use,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As many num’rous flocks of goats; his goats,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Not fewer than eleven num’rous flocks)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here also graze the margin of his fields<br></span>
<span class="i0">Under the eye of servants well-approved,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And ev’ry servant, ev’ry day, brings home <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l130" id="BXIV_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The goat, of all his flock largest and best.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But as for me, I have these swine in charge,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of which, selected with exactest care<br></span>
<span class="i0">From all the herd, I send the prime to them.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceas’d, meantime Ulysses ate and drank<br></span>
<span class="i0">Voracious, meditating, mute, the death<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of those proud suitors. His repast, at length,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Concluded, and his appetite sufficed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eumæus gave him, charged with wine, the cup<br></span>
<span class="i0">From which he drank himself; he, glad, received <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l140" id="BXIV_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The boon, and in wing’d accents thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My friend, and who was he, wealthy and brave<br></span>
<span class="i0">As thou describ’st the Chief, who purchased thee?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou say’st he perish’d for the glory-sake<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Agamemnon. Name him; I, perchance,<br></span>
<span class="i0">May have beheld the Hero. None can say<br></span>
<span class="i0">But Jove and the inhabitants of heav’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">That I ne’er saw him, and may not impart<br></span>
<span class="i0">News of him; I have roam’d through many a clime.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom the noble swine-herd thus replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l150" id="BXIV_l150"></a>150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Alas, old man! no trav’ler’s tale of him<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will gain his consort’s credence, or his son’s;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For wand’rers, wanting entertainment, forge<br></span>
<span class="i0">Falsehoods for bread, and wilfully deceive.<br></span>
<span class="i0">No wand’rer lands in Ithaca, but he seeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">With feign’d intelligence my mistress’ ear;<br></span>
<span class="i0">She welcomes all, and while she questions each<br></span>
<span class="i0">Minutely, from her lids lets fall the tear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Affectionate, as well beseems a wife<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose mate hath perish’d in a distant land. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l160" id="BXIV_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou could’st thyself, no doubt, my hoary friend!<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Would any furnish thee with decent vest<br></span>
<span class="i0">And mantle) fabricate a tale with ease;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet sure it is that dogs and fowls, long since,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His skin have stript, or fishes of the Deep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have eaten him, and on some distant shore<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whelm’d in deep sands his mould’ring bones are laid.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So hath he perish’d; whence, to all his friends,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But chiefly to myself, sorrow of heart;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For such another Lord, gentle as he, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l170" id="BXIV_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Wherever sought, I have no hope to find,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Though I should wander even to the house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of my own father. Neither yearns my heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">So feelingly (though that desiring too)<br></span>
<span class="i0">To see once more my parents and my home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As to behold Ulysses yet again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ah stranger; absent as he is, his name<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fills me with rev’rence, for he lov’d me much,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cared for me much, and, though we meet no more,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Holds still an elder brother’s part in me. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l180" id="BXIV_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d, then, the Hero toil-inured.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My friend! since his return, in thy account,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is an event impossible, and thy mind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Always incredulous that hope rejects,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I shall not slightly speak, but with an oath—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses comes again; and I demand<br></span>
<span class="i0">No more, than that the boon such news deserves,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Be giv’n me soon as he shall reach his home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then give me vest and mantle fit to wear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which, ere that hour, much as I need them both, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l190" id="BXIV_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I neither ask, nor will accept from thee.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For him whom poverty can force aside<br></span>
<span class="i0">From truth—I hate him as the gates of hell.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Be Jove, of all in heav’n, my witness first,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, this thy hospitable board, and, last,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The household Gods of the illustrious Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself, Ulysses, to whose gates I go,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That all my words shall surely be fulfill’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">In this same year Ulysses shall arrive,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ere, this month closed, another month succeed, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l200" id="BXIV_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">He shall return, and punish all who dare<br></span>
<span class="i0">Insult his consort and his noble son.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Eumæus, thou didst thus reply.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Old friend! that boon thou wilt ne’er earn from me;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses comes no more. But thou thy wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Drink quietly, and let us find, at length,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some other theme; recall not this again<br></span>
<span class="i0">To my remembrance, for my soul is grieved<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oft as reminded of my honour’d Lord.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Let the oath rest, and let Ulysses come <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l210" id="BXIV_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ev’n as myself, and as Penelope,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And as his ancient father, and his son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Godlike Telemachus, all wish he may.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ay—there I feel again—nor cease to mourn<br></span>
<span class="i0">His son Telemachus; who, when the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had giv’n him growth like a young plant, and I<br></span>
<span class="i0">Well hoped that nought inferior he should prove<br></span>
<span class="i0">In person or in mind to his own sire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath lost, through influence human or divine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I know not how, his sober intellect, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l220" id="BXIV_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And after tidings of his sire is gone<br></span>
<span class="i0">To far-famed Pylus; his return, meantime,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In ambush hidden the proud suitors wait,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That the whole house may perish of renown’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arcesias, named in Ithaca no more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But whether he have fallen or ’scaped, let him<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rest also, whom Saturnian Jove protect!<br></span>
<span class="i0">But come, my ancient guest! now let me learn<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy own afflictions; answer me in truth.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, and whence art thou? in what city born? <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l230" id="BXIV_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Where dwell thy parents; in what kind of ship<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cam’st thou? the mariners, why brought they thee<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Ithaca? and of what land are they?<br></span>
<span class="i0">For, that on foot thou found’st us not, is sure.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d, then, Ulysses, ever-wise.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will with truth resolve thee; and if here<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within thy cottage sitting, we had wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">And food for many a day, and business none<br></span>
<span class="i0">But to regale at ease while others toiled,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I could exhaust the year complete, my woes <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l240" id="BXIV_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Rehearsing, nor, at last, rehearse entire<br></span>
<span class="i0">My sorrows by the will of heav’n sustained.<br></span>
<span class="i1">I boast me sprung from ancestry renown’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">In spacious Crete; son of a wealthy sire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who other sons train’d num’rous in his house,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Born of his wedded wife; but he begat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Me on his purchased concubine, whom yet<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dear as his other sons in wedlock born<br></span>
<span class="i0">Castor Hylacides esteem’d and lov’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For him I boast my father. Him in Crete, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l250" id="BXIV_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">While yet he liv’d, all reverenc’d as a God,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So rich, so prosp’rous, and so blest was he<br></span>
<span class="i0">With sons of highest praise. But death, the doom<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all, him bore to Pluto’s drear abode,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And his illustrious sons among themselves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Portion’d his goods by lot; to me, indeed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They gave a dwelling, and but little more,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, for my virtuous qualities, I won<br></span>
<span class="i0">A wealthy bride, for I was neither vain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor base, forlorn as thou perceiv’st me now. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l260" id="BXIV_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But thou canst guess, I judge, viewing the straw<br></span>
<span class="i0">What once was in the ear. Ah! I have borne<br></span>
<span class="i0">Much tribulation; heap’d and heavy woes.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Courage and phalanx-breaking might had I<br></span>
<span class="i0">From Mars and Pallas; at what time I drew,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Planning some dread exploit) an ambush forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of our most valiant Chiefs, no boding fears<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of death seized <i>me</i>, but foremost far of all<br></span>
<span class="i0">I sprang to fight, and pierced the flying foe.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such was I once in arms. But household toils <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l270" id="BXIV_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Sustain’d for children’s sake, and carking cares<br></span>
<span class="i0">T’ enrich a family, were not for me.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My pleasures were the gallant bark, the din<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of battle, the smooth spear and glitt’ring shaft,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Objects of dread to others, but which me<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Gods disposed to love and to enjoy.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus diff’rent minds are diff’rently amused;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For ere Achaia’s fleet had sailed to Troy,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nine times was I commander of an host<br></span>
<span class="i0">Embark’d against a foreign foe, and found <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l280" id="BXIV_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In all those enterprizes great success.<br></span>
<span class="i0">From the whole booty, first, what pleased me most<br></span>
<span class="i0">Chusing, and sharing also much by lot<br></span>
<span class="i0">I rapidly grew rich, and had thenceforth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Among the Cretans rev’rence and respect.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when loud-thund’ring Jove that voyage dire<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ordain’d, which loos’d the knees of many a Greek,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, to Idomeneus and me they gave<br></span>
<span class="i0">The charge of all their fleet, which how to avoid<br></span>
<span class="i0">We found not, so importunate the cry <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l290" id="BXIV_l290"></a>290</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the whole host impell’d us to the task.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There fought we nine long years, and in the tenth<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Priam’s proud city pillag’d) steer’d again<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our galleys homeward, which the Gods dispersed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then was it that deep-planning Jove devised<br></span>
<span class="i0">For me much evil. One short month, no more,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I gave to joys domestic, in my wife<br></span>
<span class="i0">Happy, and in my babes, and in my wealth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When the desire seiz’d me with sev’ral ships<br></span>
<span class="i0">Well-rigg’d, and furnish’d all with gallant crews, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l300" id="BXIV_l300"></a>300</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To sail for Ægypt; nine I fitted forth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To which stout mariners assembled fast.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Six days the chosen partners of my voyage<br></span>
<span class="i0">Feasted, to whom I num’rous victims gave<br></span>
<span class="i0">For sacrifice, and for their own regale.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Embarking on the sev’nth from spacious Crete,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before a clear breeze prosp’rous from the North<br></span>
<span class="i0">We glided easily along, as down<br></span>
<span class="i0">A river’s stream; nor one of all my ships<br></span>
<span class="i0">Damage incurr’d, but healthy and at ease <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l310" id="BXIV_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">We sat, while gales well-managed urged us on.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The fifth day thence, smooth-flowing Nile we reach’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And safe I moor’d in the Ægyptian stream.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, charging all my mariners to keep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Strict watch for preservation of the ships,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I order’d spies into the hill-tops; but they<br></span>
<span class="i0">Under the impulse of a spirit rash<br></span>
<span class="i0">And hot for quarrel, the well-cultur’d fields<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pillaged of the Ægyptians, captive led<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their wives and little ones, and slew the men. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l320" id="BXIV_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Soon was the city alarm’d, and at the cry<br></span>
<span class="i0">Down came the citizens, by dawn of day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With horse and foot, and with the gleam of arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Filling the plain. Then Jove with panic dread<br></span>
<span class="i0">Struck all my people; none found courage more<br></span>
<span class="i0">To stand, for mischiefs swarm’d on ev’ry side.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There, num’rous by the glittering spear we fell<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slaughter’d, while others they conducted thence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alive to servitude. But Jove himself<br></span>
<span class="i0">My bosom with this thought inspired, (I would <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l330" id="BXIV_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That, dying, I had first fulfill’d my fate<br></span>
<span class="i0">In Ægypt, for new woes were yet to come!)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Loosing my brazen casque, and slipping off<br></span>
<span class="i0">My buckler, there I left them on the field,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then cast my spear away, and seeking, next,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The chariot of the sov’reign, clasp’d his knees,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And kiss’d them. He, by my submission moved,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deliver’d me, and to his chariot-seat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Raising, convey’d me weeping to his home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">With many an ashen spear his warriors sought <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l340" id="BXIV_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To slay me, (for they now grew fiery wroth)<br></span>
<span class="i0">But he, through fear of hospitable Jove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Chief punisher of wrong, saved me alive.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sev’n years I there abode, and much amass’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Among the Ægyptians, gifted by them all;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, in the eighth revolving year, arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">A shrewd Phœnician, in all fraud adept,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hungry, and who had num’rous harm’d before,<br></span>
<span class="i0">By whom I also was cajoled, and lured<br></span>
<span class="i0">T’ attend him to Phœnicia, where his house <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l350" id="BXIV_l350"></a>350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And his possessions lay; there I abode<br></span>
<span class="i0">A year complete his inmate; but (the days<br></span>
<span class="i0">And months accomplish’d of the rolling year,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the new seasons ent’ring on their course)<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Lybia then, on board his bark, by wiles<br></span>
<span class="i0">He won me with him, partner of the freight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Profess’d, but destin’d secretly to sale,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That he might profit largely by my price.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not unsuspicious, yet constrain’d to go,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With this man I embark’d. A cloudless gale <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l360" id="BXIV_l360"></a>360</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Propitious blowing from the North, our ship<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ran right before it through the middle sea,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In the offing over Crete; but adverse Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Destruction plann’d for them and death the while.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For, Crete now left afar, and other land<br></span>
<span class="i0">Appearing none, but sky alone and sea,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Right o’er the hollow bark Saturnian Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">A cloud cærulean hung, dark’ning the Deep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, thund’ring oft, he hurl’d into the bark<br></span>
<span class="i0">His bolts; she smitten by the fires of Jove, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l370" id="BXIV_l370"></a>370</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Quaked all her length; with sulphur fill’d she reek’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, o’er her sides precipitated, plunged<br></span>
<span class="i0">Like gulls the crew, forbidden by that stroke<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of wrath divine to hope their country more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But Jove himself, when I had cast away<br></span>
<span class="i0">All hope of life, conducted to my arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">The strong tall mast, that I might yet escape.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Around that beam I clung, driving before<br></span>
<span class="i0">The stormy blast. Nine days complete I drove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, on the tenth dark night, the rolling flood <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l380" id="BXIV_l380"></a>380</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Immense convey’d me to Thesprotia’s shore.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There me the Hero Phidon, gen’rous King<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Thesprotians, freely entertained;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For his own son discov’ring me with toil<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exhausted and with cold, raised me, and thence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Led me humanely to his father’s house,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who cherish’d me, and gave me fresh attire.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There heard I of Ulysses, whom himself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had entertain’d, he said, on his return<br></span>
<span class="i0">To his own land; he shew’d me also gold, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l390" id="BXIV_l390"></a>390</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Brass, and bright steel elab’rate, whatsoe’er<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses had amass’d, a store to feed<br></span>
<span class="i0">A less illustrious family than his<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the tenth generation, so immense<br></span>
<span class="i0">His treasures in the royal palace lay.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself, he said, was to Dodona gone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">There, from the tow’ring oaks of Jove to ask<br></span>
<span class="i0">Counsel divine, if openly to land<br></span>
<span class="i0">(After long absence) in his opulent realm<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ithaca, be best, or in disguise. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l400" id="BXIV_l400"></a>400</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To me the monarch swore, in his own hall<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pouring libation, that the ship was launch’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the crew ready for his conduct home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But me he first dismiss’d, for, as it chanced,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A ship lay there of the Thesprotians, bound<br></span>
<span class="i0">To green Dulichium’s isle. He bade the crew<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bear me to King Acastus with all speed;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But them far other thoughts pleased more, and thoughts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of harm to me, that I might yet be plunged<br></span>
<span class="i0">In deeper gulphs of woe than I had known. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l410" id="BXIV_l410"></a>410</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For, when the billow-cleaving bark had left<br></span>
<span class="i0">The land remote, framing, combined, a plot<br></span>
<span class="i0">Against my liberty, they stripp’d my vest<br></span>
<span class="i0">And mantle, and this tatter’d raiment foul<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gave me instead, which thy own eyes behold.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At even-tide reaching the cultur’d coast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ithaca, they left me bound on board<br></span>
<span class="i0">With tackle of the bark, and quitting ship<br></span>
<span class="i0">Themselves, made hasty supper on the shore.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But me, meantime, the Gods easily loos’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l420" id="BXIV_l420"></a>420</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">By their own pow’r, when, with wrapper vile<br></span>
<span class="i0">Around my brows, sliding into the sea<br></span>
<span class="i0">At the ship’s stern, I lay’d me on the flood.<br></span>
<span class="i0">With both hands oaring thence my course, I swam<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till past all ken of theirs; then landing where<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thick covert of luxuriant trees I mark’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Close couchant down I lay; they mutt’ring loud,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Paced to and fro, but deeming farther search<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unprofitable, soon embark’d again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus baffling all their search with ease, the Gods <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l430" id="BXIV_l430"></a>430</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Conceal’d and led me thence to the abode<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of a wise man, dooming me still to live.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! my most compassionable guest!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast much moved me by this tale minute<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy sad wand’rings and thy num’rous woes.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, speaking of Ulysses, thou hast pass’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">All credence; I at least can give thee none.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Why, noble as thou art, should’st thou invent<br></span>
<span class="i0">Palpable falsehoods? as for the return <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l440" id="BXIV_l440"></a>440</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of my regretted Lord, myself I know<br></span>
<span class="i0">That had he not been hated by the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unanimous, he had in battle died<br></span>
<span class="i0">At Troy, or (that long doubtful war, at last,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Concluded,) in his people’s arms at home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then universal Greece had raised his tomb,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he had even for his son atchiev’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Immortal glory; but alas! by beaks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of harpies torn, unseemly sight, he lies.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here is my home the while; I never seek <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l450" id="BXIV_l450"></a>450</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The city, unless summon’d by discrete<br></span>
<span class="i0">Penelope to listen to the news<br></span>
<span class="i0">Brought by some stranger, whencesoe’er arrived.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, all, alike inquisitive, attend,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both who regret the absence of our King,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And who rejoice gratuitous to gorge<br></span>
<span class="i0">His property; but as for me, no joy<br></span>
<span class="i0">Find I in list’ning after such reports,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Since an Ætolian cozen’d me, who found<br></span>
<span class="i0">(After long wand’ring over various lands <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l460" id="BXIV_l460"></a>460</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A fugitive for blood) my lone retreat.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Him warm I welcom’d, and with open arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Receiv’d, who bold affirm’d that he had seen<br></span>
<span class="i0">My master with Idomeneus at Crete<br></span>
<span class="i0">His ships refitting shatter’d by a storm,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And that in summer with his godlike band<br></span>
<span class="i0">He would return, bringing great riches home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or else in autumn. And thou ancient guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forlorn! since thee the Gods have hither led,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seek not to gratify me with untruths <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l470" id="BXIV_l470"></a>470</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And to deceive me, since for no such cause<br></span>
<span class="i0">I shall respect or love thee, but alone<br></span>
<span class="i0">By pity influenced, and the fear of Jove.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast, in truth, a most incredulous mind,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom even with an oath I have not moved,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or aught persuaded. Come then—let us make<br></span>
<span class="i0">In terms express a cov’nant, and the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who hold Olympus, witness to us both!<br></span>
<span class="i0">If thy own Lord at this thy house arrive, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l480" id="BXIV_l480"></a>480</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt dismiss me decently attired<br></span>
<span class="i0">In vest and mantle, that I may repair<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hence to Dulichium, whither I would go.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, if thy Lord come not, then, gath’ring all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy servants, headlong hurl me from a rock,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That other mendicants may fear to lie.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom the generous swine-herd in return.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, stranger! doubtless I should high renown<br></span>
<span class="i0">Obtain for virtue among men, both now<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in all future times, if, having first <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l490" id="BXIV_l490"></a>490</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Invited thee, and at my board regaled,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I, next, should slay thee; then my pray’rs would mount,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Past question, swiftly to Saturnian Jove.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But the hour calls to supper, and, ere long,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The partners of my toils will come prepared<br></span>
<span class="i0">To spread the board with no unsav’ry cheer.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus they conferr’d. And now the swains arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Driving their charge, which fast they soon enclosed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within their customary penns, and loud<br></span>
<span class="i0">The hubbub was of swine prison’d within. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l500" id="BXIV_l500"></a>500</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then call’d the master to his rustic train.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bring ye the best, that we may set him forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before my friend from foreign climes arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With whom ourselves will also feast, who find<br></span>
<span class="i0">The bright-tusk’d multitude a painful charge,<br></span>
<span class="i0">While others, at no cost of theirs, consume<br></span>
<span class="i0">Day after day, the profit of our toils.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, his wood for fuel he prepared,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And dragging thither a well-fatted brawn<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the fifth year his servants held him fast <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l510" id="BXIV_l510"></a>510</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">At the hearth-side. Nor failed the master swain<br></span>
<span class="i0">T’ adore the Gods, (for wise and good was he)<br></span>
<span class="i0">But consecration of the victim, first,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself performing, cast into the fire<br></span>
<span class="i0">The forehead bristles of the tusky boar,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then pray’d to all above, that, safe, at length,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses might regain his native home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then lifting an huge shive that lay beside<br></span>
<span class="i0">The fire, he smote the boar, and dead he fell,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Next, piercing him, and scorching close his hair, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l520" id="BXIV_l520"></a>520</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">They carv’d him quickly, and Eumæus spread<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thin slices crude taken from ev’ry limb<br></span>
<span class="i0">O’er all his fat, then other slices cast,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sprinkling them first with meal, into the fire.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The rest they slash’d and scored, and roasted well,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And placed it, heap’d together, on the board.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then rose the good Eumæus to his task<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of distribution, for he understood<br></span>
<span class="i0">The hospitable entertainer’s part.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sev’n-fold partition of the banquet made, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l530" id="BXIV_l530"></a>530</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">He gave, with previous pray’r, to Maia’s son<a name="fnm_63" id="fnm_63"></a><a href="#fn_63" class="fnnum">63</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">And to the nymphs one portion of the whole,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then served his present guests, honouring first<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses with the boar’s perpetual chine;<br></span>
<span class="i0">By that distinction just his master’s heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">He gratified, and thus the Hero spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Eumæus! be thou as belov’d of Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">As thou art dear to me, whom, though attired<br></span>
<span class="i0">So coarsely, thou hast served with such respect!<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l540" id="BXIV_l540"></a>540</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Eat, noble stranger! and refreshment take<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such as thou may’st; God<a name="fnm_64" id="fnm_64"></a><a href="#fn_64" class="fnnum">64</a> gives, and God denies<br></span>
<span class="i0">At his own will, for He is Lord of all.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and to the everlasting Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">The firstlings sacrificed of all, then made<br></span>
<span class="i0">Libation, and the cup placed in the hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of city-spoiler Laertiades<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sitting beside his own allotted share.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, Mesaulius bread dispensed to all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom, in the absence of his Lord, himself <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l550" id="BXIV_l550"></a>550</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Eumæus had from Taphian traders bought<br></span>
<span class="i0">With his own proper goods, at no expence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Either to old Laertes or the Queen.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now, all stretch’d their hands toward the feast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reeking before them, and when hunger none<br></span>
<span class="i0">Felt more or thirst, Mesaulius clear’d the board.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, fed to full satiety, in haste<br></span>
<span class="i0">Each sought his couch. Black came a moonless night,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Jove all night descended fast in show’rs,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With howlings of the ever wat’ry West. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l560" id="BXIV_l560"></a>560</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, at that sound, for trial sake<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of his good host, if putting off his cloak<br></span>
<span class="i0">He would accommodate him, or require<br></span>
<span class="i0">That service for him at some other hand,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Addressing thus the family, began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Hear now, Eumæus, and ye other swains<br></span>
<span class="i0">His fellow-lab’rers! I shall somewhat boast,<br></span>
<span class="i0">By wine befool’d, which forces ev’n the wise<br></span>
<span class="i0">To carol loud, to titter and to dance,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And words to utter, oft, better suppress’d. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l570" id="BXIV_l570"></a>570</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But since I have begun, I shall proceed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Prating my fill. Ah might those days return<br></span>
<span class="i0">With all the youth and strength that I enjoy’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When in close ambush, once, at Troy we lay!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, Menelaus, and myself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their chosen coadjutor, led the band.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Approaching to the city’s lofty wall<br></span>
<span class="i0">Through the thick bushes and the reeds that gird<br></span>
<span class="i0">The bulwarks, down we lay flat in the marsh,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Under our arms, then Boreas blowing loud, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l580" id="BXIV_l580"></a>580</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A rueful night came on, frosty and charged<br></span>
<span class="i0">With snow that blanch’d us thick as morning rime,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And ev’ry shield with ice was crystall’d o’er.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The rest with cloaks and vests well cover’d, slept<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath their bucklers; I alone my cloak,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Improvident, had left behind, no thought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Conceiving of a season so severe;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shield and belt, therefore, and nought else had I.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The night, at last, nigh spent, and all the stars<br></span>
<span class="i0">Declining in their course, with elbow thrust <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l590" id="BXIV_l590"></a>590</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Against Ulysses’ side I roused the Chief,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thus address’d him ever prompt to hear.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Laertes’ noble son, for wiles renown’d!<br></span>
<span class="i0">I freeze to death. Help me, or I am lost.<br></span>
<span class="i0">No cloak have I; some evil dæmon, sure,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beguil’d me of all prudence, that I came<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus sparely clad; I shall, I must expire.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So I; he, ready as he was in arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">And counsel both, the remedy at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">Devised, and thus, low-whisp’ring, answer’d me. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l600" id="BXIV_l600"></a>600</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Hush! lest perchance some other hear—He said,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And leaning on his elbow, spake aloud.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My friends! all hear—a monitory dream<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath reach’d me, for we lie far from the ships.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Haste, therefore, one of you, with my request<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Agamemnon, Atreus’ son, our Chief,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That he would reinforce us from the camp.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake, and at the word, Andræmon’s son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thoas arose, who, casting off his cloak,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ran thence toward the ships, and folded warm <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l610" id="BXIV_l610"></a>610</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Within it, there lay I till dawn appear’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh for the vigour of such youth again!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, some good peasant here, either for love<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or for respect, would cloak a man like me,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom, now, thus sordid in attire ye scorn.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My ancient guest! I cannot but approve<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy narrative, nor hast thou utter’d aught<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unseemly, or that needs excuse. No want<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of raiment, therefore, or of aught beside <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l620" id="BXIV_l620"></a>620</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Needful to solace penury like thine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall harm thee here; yet, at the peep of dawn<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gird thy own tatters to thy loins again;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For <i>we</i> have no great store of cloaks to boast,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or change of vests, but singly one for each.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when Ulysses’ son shall once arrive,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He will himself with vest and mantle both<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cloath thee, and send thee whither most thou would’st.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he rose, and nearer made his couch<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the hearth-side, spreading it thick with skins <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l630" id="BXIV_l630"></a>630</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of sheep and goats; then lay the Hero down,<br></span>
<span class="i0">O’er whom a shaggy mantle large he threw,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which oft-times served him with a change, when rough<br></span>
<span class="i0">The winter’s blast and terrible arose.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So was Ulysses bedded, and the youths<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slept all beside him; but the master-swain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Chose not his place of rest so far remote<br></span>
<span class="i0">From his rude charge, but to the outer court<br></span>
<span class="i0">With his nocturnal furniture, repair’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gladd’ning Ulysses’ heart that one so true <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l640" id="BXIV_l640"></a>640</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In his own absence kept his rural stores.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Athwart his sturdy shoulders, first, he flung<br></span>
<span class="i0">His faulchion keen, then wrapp’d him in a cloak<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thick-woven, winter-proof; he lifted, next,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The skin of a well-thriven goat, in bulk<br></span>
<span class="i0">Surpassing others, and his javelin took<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sharp-pointed, with which dogs he drove and men.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus arm’d, he sought his wonted couch beneath<br></span>
<span class="i0">A hollow rock where the herd slept, secure<br></span>
<span class="i0">From the sharp current of the Northern blast. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIV_l650" id="BXIV_l650"></a>650</span><br></span>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">Telemachus, admonished by Minerva, takes leave of Menelaus, but ere he
sails, is accosted by Theoclymenos, a prophet of Argos, whom at his
earnest request he takes on board. In the meantime Eumæus relates to
Ulysses the means by which he came to Ithaca. Telemachus arriving there,
gives orders for the return of his bark to the city, and repairs himself
to Eumæus.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Meantime to Lacedæmon’s spacious vale<br></span>
<span class="i0">Minerva went, that she might summon thence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses’ glorious son to his own home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arrived, she found Telemachus reposed<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Nestor’s son beneath the vestibule<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Menelaus, mighty Chief; she saw<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pisistratus in bands of gentle sleep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fast-bound, but not Telemachus; his mind<br></span>
<span class="i0">No rest enjoy’d, by filial cares disturb’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the silent night, when, drawing near <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l10" id="BXV_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To his couch side, the Goddess thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thou canst no longer prudently remain<br></span>
<span class="i0">A wand’rer here, Telemachus! thy home<br></span>
<span class="i0">Abandon’d, and those haughty suitors left<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within thy walls; fear lest, partition made<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy possessions, they devour the whole,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in the end thy voyage bootless prove.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Delay not; from brave Menelaus ask<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dismission hence, that thou may’st find at home<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy spotless mother, whom her brethren urge <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l20" id="BXV_l20"></a>20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And her own father even now to wed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eurymachus, in gifts and in amount<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of proffer’d dow’r superior to them all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some treasure, else, shall haply from thy house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Be taken, such as thou wilt grudge to spare.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For well thou know’st how woman is disposed;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her whole anxiety is to encrease<br></span>
<span class="i0">His substance whom she weds; no care hath she<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of her first children, or remembers more<br></span>
<span class="i0">The buried husband of her virgin choice. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l30" id="BXV_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Returning then, to her of all thy train<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom thou shalt most approve, the charge commit<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy concerns domestic, till the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Themselves shall guide thee to a noble wife.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hear also this, and mark it. In the frith<br></span>
<span class="i0">Samos the rude, and Ithaca between,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The chief of all her suitors thy return<br></span>
<span class="i0">In vigilant ambush wait, with strong desire<br></span>
<span class="i0">To slay thee, ere thou reach thy native shore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But shall not, as I judge, till the earth hide <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l40" id="BXV_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Many a lewd reveller at thy expence.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, steer thy galley from those isles afar,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And voyage make by night; some guardian God<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall save thee, and shall send thee prosp’rous gales.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, soon as thou attain’st the nearest shore<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ithaca, dispatching to the town<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy bark with all thy people, seek at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">The swine-herd; for Eumæus is thy friend.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There sleep, and send him forth into the town<br></span>
<span class="i0">With tidings to Penelope, that safe <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l50" id="BXV_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art restored from Pylus home again.<br></span>
<span class="i1">She said, and sought th’ Olympian heights sublime.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, with his heel shaking him, he awoke<br></span>
<span class="i0">The son of Nestor, whom he thus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Rise, Nestor’s son, Pisistratus! lead forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">The steeds, and yoke them. We must now depart.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom the son of Nestor thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus! what haste soe’er we feel,<br></span>
<span class="i0">We can by no means prudently attempt<br></span>
<span class="i0">To drive by night, and soon it will be dawn. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l60" id="BXV_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Stay, therefore, till the Hero, Atreus’ son,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Spear-practis’d Menelaus shall his gifts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Place in the chariot, and with kind farewell<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dismiss thee; for the guest in mem’ry holds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Through life, the host who treats him as a friend.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Scarce had he spoken, when the golden dawn<br></span>
<span class="i0">Appearing, Menelaus, from the side<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of beauteous Helen ris’n, their bed approach’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose coming when Telemachus perceived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cloathing himself hastily in his vest <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l70" id="BXV_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Magnificent, and o’er his shoulders broad<br></span>
<span class="i0">Casting his graceful mantle, at the door<br></span>
<span class="i0">He met the Hero, whom he thus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Atrides, Menelaus, Chief renown’d!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dismiss me hence to Ithaca again,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My native isle, for I desire to go.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d Menelaus famed in arms.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus! I will not long delay<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy wish’d return. I disapprove alike<br></span>
<span class="i0">The host whose assiduity extreme <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l80" id="BXV_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Distresses, and whose negligence offends;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The middle course is best; alike we err,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Him thrusting forth whose wish is to remain,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And hind’ring the impatient to depart.<br></span>
<span class="i0">This only is true kindness—To regale<br></span>
<span class="i0">The present guest, and speed him when he would.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet stay, till thou shalt see my splendid gifts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Placed in thy chariot, and till I command<br></span>
<span class="i0">My women from our present stores to spread<br></span>
<span class="i0">The table with a plentiful repast. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l90" id="BXV_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For both the honour of the guest demands,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And his convenience also, that he eat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sufficient, ent’ring on a length of road.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But if through Hellas thou wilt take thy way<br></span>
<span class="i0">And traverse Argos, I will, then, myself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attend thee; thou shalt journey with my steeds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath thy yoke, and I will be thy guide<br></span>
<span class="i0">To many a city, whence we shall not go<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ungratified, but shall in each receive<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some gift at least, tripod, or charger bright, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l100" id="BXV_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Or golden chalice, or a pair of mules.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Atrides, Menelaus, Chief renown’d!<br></span>
<span class="i0">I would at once depart, (for guardian none<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of my possessions have I left behind)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lest, while I seek my father, I be lost<br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself, or lose what I should grudge to spare.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Which when the valiant Menelaus heard,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He bade his spouse and maidens spread the board<br></span>
<span class="i0">At once with remnants of the last regale. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l110" id="BXV_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then Eteoneus came, Boetheus’ son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Newly aris’n, for nigh at hand he dwelt,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Menelaus bade kindle the fire<br></span>
<span class="i0">By which to dress their food, and he obey’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He next, himself his fragrant chamber sought,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not sole, but by his spouse and by his son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attended, Megapenthes. There arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where all his treasures lay, Atrides, first,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Took forth, himself, a goblet, then consign’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To his son’s hand an argent beaker bright. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l120" id="BXV_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, beside her coffers Helen stood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where lay her variegated robes, fair works<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of her own hand. Producing one, in size<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in magnificence the chief, a star<br></span>
<span class="i0">For splendour, and the lowest placed of all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Loveliest of her sex, she bore it thence.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, all proceeding through the house, they sought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus again, whom reaching, thus<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Hero of the golden locks began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">May Jove the Thunderer, dread Juno’s mate, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l130" id="BXV_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Grant thee, Telemachus! such voyage home<br></span>
<span class="i0">As thy own heart desires! accept from all<br></span>
<span class="i0">My stores selected as the richest far<br></span>
<span class="i0">And noblest gift for finish’d beauty—This.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I give thee wrought elaborate a cup,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Itself all silver, bound with lip of gold.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It is the work of Vulcan, which to me<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Hero Phædimus imparted, King<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Sidonians, when, on my return,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath his roof I lodg’d. I make it thine. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l140" id="BXV_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, the Hero, Atreus’ son, the cup<br></span>
<span class="i0">Placed in his hands, and Megapenthes set<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before him, next, the argent beaker bright;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But lovely Helen drawing nigh, the robe<br></span>
<span class="i0">Presented to him, whom she thus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">I also give thee, oh my son, a gift,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which seeing, thou shalt think on her whose hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wrought it; a present on thy nuptial day<br></span>
<span class="i0">For thy fair spouse; meantime, repose it safe<br></span>
<span class="i0">In thy own mother’s keeping. Now, farewell! <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l150" id="BXV_l150"></a>150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Prosp’rous and happy be thy voyage home!<br></span>
<span class="i1">She ceas’d, and gave it to him, who the gift<br></span>
<span class="i0">Accepted glad, and in the chariot-chest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pisistratus the Hero all disposed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Admiring them the while. They, following, next,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Hero Menelaus to his hall<br></span>
<span class="i0">Each on his couch or on his throne reposed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">A maiden, then, with golden ewer charged<br></span>
<span class="i0">And silver bowl, pour’d water on their hands,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And spread the polish’d table, which with food <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l160" id="BXV_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Various, selected from her present stores,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The mistress of the household charge supplied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Boetheus’ son stood carver, and to each<br></span>
<span class="i0">His portion gave, while Megapenthes, son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of glorious Menelaus, serv’d the cup.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, all with outstretch’d hands the feast assail’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And when nor hunger more nor thirst of wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">They felt, Telemachus and Nestor’s son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yoked the swift steeds, and, taking each his seat<br></span>
<span class="i0">In the resplendent chariot, drove at once <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l170" id="BXV_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Right through the sounding portico abroad.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But Menelaus, Hero amber-hair’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A golden cup bearing with richest wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Replete in his right hand, follow’d them forth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That not without libation first perform’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">They might depart; he stood before the steeds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And drinking first, thus, courteous, them bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Health to you both, young friends! and from my lips<br></span>
<span class="i0">Like greeting bear to Nestor, royal Chief,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For he was ever as a father kind <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l180" id="BXV_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To me, while the Achaians warr’d at Troy.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Telemachus discrete replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And doubtless, so we will; at our return<br></span>
<span class="i0">We will report to him, illustrious Prince!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy ev’ry word. And oh, I would to heav’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">That reaching Ithaca, I might at home<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses hail as sure, as I shall hence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Depart, with all benevolence by thee<br></span>
<span class="i0">Treated, and rich in many a noble gift.<br></span>
<span class="i1">While thus he spake, on his right hand appear’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l190" id="BXV_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">An eagle; in his talons pounced he bore<br></span>
<span class="i0">A white-plumed goose domestic, newly ta’en<br></span>
<span class="i0">From the house-court. Ran females all and males<br></span>
<span class="i0">Clamorous after him; but he the steeds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Approaching on the right, sprang into air.<br></span>
<span class="i0">That sight rejoicing and with hearts reviv’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">They view’d, and thus Pisistratus his speech<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amid them all to Menelaus turn’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Now, Menelaus, think, illustrious Chief!<br></span>
<span class="i0">If us, this omen, or thyself regard. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l200" id="BXV_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">While warlike Menelaus musing stood<br></span>
<span class="i0">What answer fit to frame, Helen meantime,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His spouse long-stoled preventing him, began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Hear me; for I will answer as the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Teach me, and as I think shall come to pass.<br></span>
<span class="i0">As he, descending from his place of birth<br></span>
<span class="i0">The mountains, caught our pamper’d goose away,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So shall Ulysses, after many woes<br></span>
<span class="i0">And wand’rings to his home restored, avenge<br></span>
<span class="i0">His wrongs, or even now is at his home <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l210" id="BXV_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For all those suitors sowing seeds of woe.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh grant it Jove, Juno’s high-thund’ring mate!<br></span>
<span class="i0">So will I, there arrived, with vow and pray’r<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thee worship, as thou wert, thyself, divine.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and lash’d the coursers; fiery they<br></span>
<span class="i0">And fleet, sprang through the city to the plain.<br></span>
<span class="i0">All day the yoke on either side they shook,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Journeying swift; and now the setting sun<br></span>
<span class="i0">To gloomy evening had resign’d the roads, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l220" id="BXV_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">When they to Pheræ came, and in the house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of good Diocles slept, their lib’ral host,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose sire Orsilochus from Alpheus sprang.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when Aurora, daughter of the Dawn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Look’d rosy from the East, yoking their steeds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They in the sumptuous chariot sat again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forth through the vestibule they drove, and through<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sounding portico, when Nestor’s son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Plied brisk the scourge, and willing flew the steeds.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus whirl’d along, soon they approach’d the gates <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l230" id="BXV_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Pylus, when Telemachus, his speech<br></span>
<span class="i0">Turning to his companion, thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">How, son of Nestor! shall I win from thee<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not promise only, but performance kind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of my request? we are not bound alone<br></span>
<span class="i0">To friendship by the friendship of our sires,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But by equality of years, and this<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our journey shall unite us still the more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bear me not, I intreat thee, noble friend!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the ship, but drop me at her side, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l240" id="BXV_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Lest ancient Nestor, though against my will,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Detain me in his palace through desire<br></span>
<span class="i0">To feast me, for I dread the least delay.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake; then mused Pisistratus how best<br></span>
<span class="i0">He might effect the wishes of his friend,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thus at length resolved; turning his steeds<br></span>
<span class="i0">With sudden deviation to the shore<br></span>
<span class="i0">He sought the bark, and placing in the stern<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both gold and raiment, the illustrious gifts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Menelaus, thus, in accents wing’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l250" id="BXV_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With ardour, urged Telemachus away.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Dispatch, embark, summon thy crew on board,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ere my arrival notice give of thine<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the old King; for vehement I know<br></span>
<span class="i0">His temper, neither will he let thee hence,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, hasting hither, will himself enforce<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy longer stay, that thou may’st not depart<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ungifted; nought will fire his anger more.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he to the Pylian city urged<br></span>
<span class="i0">His steeds bright-maned, and at the palace-gate <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l260" id="BXV_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Arrived of Nestor speedily; meantime<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus exhorted thus his crew.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My gallant friends! set all your tackle, climb<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sable bark, for I would now return.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake; they heard him gladly, and at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">All fill’d the benches. While his voyage he<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus expedited, and beside the stern<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Pallas sacrifice perform’d and pray’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A stranger, born remote, who had escaped<br></span>
<span class="i0">From Argos, fugitive for blood, a seer <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l270" id="BXV_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">Meantime, Melampus in the house endured<br></span>

<span class="i0">King Neleus’ daughter fair, the promis’d bride.<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Argos steed-renown’d he journey’d next,<br></span>

<span class="i0">He married, built a palace, and became<br></span>
<span class="i0">Father of two brave sons, Antiphates<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Mantius; to Antiphates was born<br></span>
<span class="i0">The brave Oïcleus; from Oïcleus sprang<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amphiaraüs, demagogue renown’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom with all tenderness, and as a friend<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alike the Thund’rer and Apollo prized;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet reach’d he not the bounds of hoary age.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But by his mercenary consort’s arts<a name="fnm_66" id="fnm_66"></a><a href="#fn_66" class="fnnum">66</a><br></span>

<span class="i0">He ’gat Alcmæon and Amphilocus.<br></span>

<span class="i0">Who now approach’d; he found Telemachus<br></span>
<span class="i0">Libation off’ring in his bark, and pray’r,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in wing’d accents ardent him address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ah, friend! since sacrificing in this place<br></span>
<span class="i0">I find thee, by these sacred rites and those<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom thou ador’st, and by thy own dear life,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And by the lives of these thy mariners<br></span>

<span class="i0">Who art thou? whence? where born? and sprung from whom?<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will inform thee, stranger! and will solve<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy questions with much truth. I am by birth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ithacan, and Ulysses was my sire.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But he hath perish’d by a woeful death,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I, believing it, with these have plow’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The ocean hither, int’rested to learn<br></span>
<span class="i0">A father’s fate long absent from his home.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer’d godlike Theoclymenus. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l330" id="BXV_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I also am a wand’rer, having slain<br></span>
<span class="i0">A man of my own tribe; brethren and friends<br></span>
<span class="i0">Num’rous had he in Argos steed-renown’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And pow’rful are the Achaians dwelling there.<br></span>
<span class="i0">From them, through terrour of impending death,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I fly, a banish’d man henceforth for ever.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ah save a suppliant fugitive! lest death<br></span>
<span class="i0">O’ertake me, for I doubt not their pursuit.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Whom thus Telemachus answer’d discrete.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I shall not, be assured, since thou desir’st <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l340" id="BXV_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To join me, chace thee from my bark away.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Follow me, therefore, and with us partake,<br></span>

<span class="i1">So saying, he at the stranger’s hand received<br></span>
<span class="i0">His spear, which on the deck he lay’d, then climb’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself the bark, and, seated in the stern,<br></span>
<span class="i0">At his own side placed Theoclymenus.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They cast the hawsers loose; then with loud voice<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus exhorted all to hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">The tackle, whom the sailors prompt obey’d. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l350" id="BXV_l350"></a>350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The tall mast heaving, in its socket deep<br></span>
<span class="i0">They lodg’d it, and its cordage braced secure,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, straining at the halyards, hoised the sail.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fair wind, and blowing fresh through æther pure<br></span>
<span class="i0">Minerva sent them, that the bark might run<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her nimblest course through all the briny way.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now sank the sun, and dusky ev’ning dimm’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The waves, when, driven by propitious Jove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His bark stood right for Pheræ; thence she stretch’d<br></span>

<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, toil-inured.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I wish thee, O Eumæus! dear to Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">As thou art dear to me, for this reprieve<br></span>
<span class="i0">Vouchsafed me kind, from wand’ring and from woe!<br></span>
<span class="i0">No worse condition is of mortal man<br></span>
<span class="i0">Than his who wanders; for the poor man, driv’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">By woe and by misfortune homeless forth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand mis’ries, day by day, endures.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Since thou detain’st me, then, and bidd’st me wait<br></span>

<span class="i1">To whom the master swine-herd thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will inform thee, and with strictest truth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all that thou hast ask’d. Laertes lives,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But supplication off’ring to the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ceaseless, to free him from a weary life,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Old age on him, or ere its date arrived.<br></span>

<span class="i0">While yet she liv’d, dejected as she was,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I found it yet some solace to converse<br></span>
<span class="i0">With her, who rear’d me in my childish days,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Together with her lovely youngest-born <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l440" id="BXV_l440"></a>440</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The Princess Ctimena; for side by side<br></span>
<span class="i0">We grew, and I, scarce honour’d less than she.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But soon as our delightful prime we both<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attain’d, to Samos her they sent, a bride,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And were requited with rich dow’r; but me<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cloath’d handsomely with tunic and with vest,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with fair sandals furnish’d, to the field<br></span>
<span class="i0">She order’d forth, yet loved me still the more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I miss her kindness now; but gracious heav’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">Prospers the work on which I here attend; <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l450" id="BXV_l450"></a>450</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Hence have I food, and hence I drink, and hence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Refresh, sometimes, a worthy guest like thee.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But kindness none experience I, or can,<br></span>
<span class="i0">From fair Penelope (my mistress now)<br></span>
<span class="i0">In word or action, so is the house curs’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With that lewd throng. Glad would the servants be<br></span>
<span class="i0">Might they approach their mistress, and receive<br></span>
<span class="i0">Advice from her; glad too to eat and drink,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And somewhat bear each to his rural home,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Alas! good swain, Eumæus, how remote<br></span>

<span class="i1">To whom the master swine-herd in reply.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stranger! since thou art curious to be told<br></span>
<span class="i0">My story, silent listen, and thy wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">At leisure quaff. The nights are longest now,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And such as time for sleep afford, and time<br></span>
<span class="i0">For pleasant conf’rence; neither were it good<br></span>
<span class="i0">That thou should’st to thy couch before thy hour,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Since even sleep is hurtful, in excess.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whoever here is weary, and desires<br></span>

<span class="i0">And, at the peep of day, when he hath fed<br></span>

<span class="i0">No famine knows that people, or disease<br></span>
<span class="i0">Noisome, of all that elsewhere seize the race<br></span>

<span class="i0">Two cities share between them all the isle,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And both were subject to my father’s sway<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ctesius Ormenides, a godlike Chief.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It chanced that from Phœnicia, famed for skill<br></span>
<span class="i0">In arts marine, a vessel thither came<br></span>
<span class="i0">By sharpers mann’d, and laden deep with toys.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now, in my father’s family abode<br></span>
<span class="i0">A fair Phœnician, tall, full-sized, and skill’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">In works of elegance, whom they beguiled.<br></span>
<span class="i0">While she wash’d linen on the beach, beside <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l510" id="BXV_l510"></a>510</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The ship, a certain mariner of those<br></span>

<span class="i0">And sober, feeble prove by love assail’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who was she, he enquired, and whence? nor she<br></span>
<span class="i0">Scrupled to tell at once her father’s home.<br></span>
<span class="i1">I am of Sidon,<a name="fnm_70" id="fnm_70"></a><a href="#fn_70" class="fnnum">70</a> famous for her works<br></span>
<span class="i0">In brass and steel; daughter of Arybas,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who rolls in affluence; Taphian pirates thence<br></span>

<span class="i1">Then answer thus her paramour return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou not hence to Sidon in our ship,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That thou may’st once more visit the abode<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy own wealthy parents, and themselves?<br></span>
<span class="i0">For still they live, and still are wealthy deem’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom the woman. Even that might be,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Would ye, ye seamen, by a solemn oath<br></span>
<span class="i0">Assure me of a safe conveyance home.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then sware the mariners as she required,<br></span>

<span class="i0">The woman of Phœnicia them bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Now, silence! no man, henceforth, of you all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Accost me, though he meet me on the road,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or at yon fountain; lest some tattler run<br></span>
<span class="i0">With tidings home to my old master’s ear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, with suspicion touch’d, may <i>me</i> confine<br></span>
<span class="i0">In cruel bonds, and death contrive for <i>you</i>.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But be ye close; purchase your stores in haste;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And when your vessel shall be freighted full,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Quick send me notice, for I mean to bring <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l540" id="BXV_l540"></a>540</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">What gold soever opportune I find,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And will my passage cheerfully defray<br></span>
<span class="i0">With still another moveable. I nurse<br></span>
<span class="i0">The good man’s son, an urchin shrewd, of age<br></span>
<span class="i0">To scamper at my side; him will I bring,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom at some foreign market ye shall prove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Saleable at what price soe’er ye will.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, she to my father’s house return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They, there abiding the whole year, their ship<br></span>
<span class="i0">With purchased goods freighted of ev’ry kind, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l550" id="BXV_l550"></a>550</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And when, her lading now complete, she lay<br></span>
<span class="i0">For sea prepared, their messenger arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">To summon down the woman to the shore.<br></span>
<span class="i0">A mariner of theirs, subtle and shrewd,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, ent’ring at my father’s gate, produced<br></span>
<span class="i0">A splendid collar, gold with amber strung.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My mother (then at home) with all her maids<br></span>
<span class="i0">Handling and gazing on it with delight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Proposed to purchase it, and he the nod<br></span>
<span class="i0">Significant, gave unobserv’d, the while, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l560" id="BXV_l560"></a>560</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To the Phœnician woman, and return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She, thus informed, leading me by the hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Went forth, and finding in the vestibule<br></span>
<span class="i0">The cups and tables which my father’s guests<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had used, (but they were to the forum gone<br></span>
<span class="i0">For converse with their friends assembled there)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Convey’d three cups into her bosom-folds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And bore them off, whom I a thoughtless child<br></span>
<span class="i0">Accompanied, at the decline of day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When dusky evening had embrown’d the shore. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l570" id="BXV_l570"></a>570</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">We, stepping nimbly on, soon reach’d the port<br></span>
<span class="i0">Renown’d, where that Phœnician vessel lay.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They shipp’d us both, and all embarking cleav’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their liquid road, by favourable gales,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Jove’s gift, impell’d. Six days we day and night<br></span>
<span class="i0">Continual sailed, but when Saturnian Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now bade the sev’nth bright morn illume the skies,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, shaft-arm’d Dian struck the woman dead.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At once she pitch’d headlong into the bilge<br></span>
<span class="i0">Like a sea-coot, whence heaving her again, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l580" id="BXV_l580"></a>580</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The seamen gave her to be fishes’ food,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I survived to mourn her. But the winds<br></span>
<span class="i0">And rolling billows them bore to the coast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ithaca, where with his proper goods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laertes bought me. By such means it chanced<br></span>
<span class="i0">That e’er I saw the isle in which I dwell.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, glorious Chief, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eumæus! thou hast moved me much, thy woes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enumerating thus at large. But Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath neighbour’d all thy evil with this good, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l590" id="BXV_l590"></a>590</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That after num’rous sorrows thou hast reach’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The house of a kind master, at whose hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy sustenance is sure, and here thou lead’st<br></span>
<span class="i0">A tranquil life; but I have late arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">City after city of the world explored.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus mutual they conferr’d, nor leisure found<br></span>
<span class="i0">Save for short sleep, by morning soon surprized.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the comrades of Telemachus<br></span>
<span class="i0">Approaching land, cast loose the sail, and lower’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alert the mast, then oar’d the vessel in. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l600" id="BXV_l600"></a>600</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The anchors heav’d aground,<a name="fnm_71" id="fnm_71"></a><a href="#fn_71" class="fnnum">71</a> and hawsers tied<br></span>
<span class="i0">Secure, themselves, forth-issuing on the shore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Breakfast prepared, and charged their cups with wine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">When neither hunger now, nor thirst remained<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unsatisfied, Telemachus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Push ye the sable bark without delay<br></span>
<span class="i0">Home to the city. I will to the field<br></span>
<span class="i0">Among my shepherds, and, (my rural works<br></span>
<span class="i0">Survey’d,) at eve will to the town return.<br></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow will I set before you wine <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l610" id="BXV_l610"></a>610</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And plenteous viands, wages of your toil.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom the godlike Theoclymenus.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whither must I, my son? who, of the Chiefs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of rugged Ithaca, shall harbour me?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I to thine and to thy mother’s house?<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then thus Telemachus, discrete, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I would invite thee to proceed at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">To our abode, since nought should fail thee there<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of kind reception, but it were a course<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now not adviseable; for I must myself, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l620" id="BXV_l620"></a>620</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Be absent, neither would my mother’s eyes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Behold thee, so unfrequent she appears<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before the suitors, shunning whom, she sits<br></span>
<span class="i0">Weaving continual at the palace-top.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But I will name to thee another Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom thou may’st seek, Eurymachus, the son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Renown’d of prudent Polybus, whom all<br></span>
<span class="i0">The people here reverence as a God.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Far noblest of them all is he, and seeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">More ardent than his rivals far, to wed <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l630" id="BXV_l630"></a>630</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">My mother, and to fill my father’s throne.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, He who dwells above, Jove only knows<br></span>
<span class="i0">If some disastrous day be not ordain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">For them, or ere those nuptials shall arrive.<br></span>
<span class="i1">While thus he spake, at his right hand appear’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Messenger of Apollo, on full wing,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A falcon; in his pounces clench’d he bore<br></span>
<span class="i0">A dove, which rending, down he pour’d her plumes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Between the galley and Telemachus.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, calling him apart, the prophet lock’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l640" id="BXV_l640"></a>640</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His hand in his, and thus explain’d the sign.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Not undirected by the Gods his flight<br></span>
<span class="i0">On our right hand, Telemachus! this hawk<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath wing’d propitious; soon as I perceived<br></span>
<span class="i0">I knew him ominous—In all the isle<br></span>
<span class="i0">No family of a more royal note<br></span>
<span class="i0">Than yours is found, and yours shall still prevail.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Whom thus Telemachus answer’d discrete.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grant heav’n, my guest! that this good word of thine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fail not, and soon thou shalt such bounty share <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l650" id="BXV_l650"></a>650</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And friendship at my hands, that, at first sight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whoe’er shall meet thee shall pronounce thee blest.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then, to Piræus thus, his friend approved.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Piræus, son of Clytius! (for of all<br></span>
<span class="i0">My followers to the shore of Pylus, none<br></span>
<span class="i0">More prompt than thou hath my desires perform’d)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now also to thy own abode conduct<br></span>
<span class="i0">This stranger, whom with hospitable care<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cherish and honour till myself arrive.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Piræus answer’d, spear-renown’d. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l660" id="BXV_l660"></a>660</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus! however long thy stay,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Punctual I will attend him, and no want<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of hospitality shall he find with me.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he climb’d the ship, then bade the crew<br></span>
<span class="i0">Embarking also, cast the hawsers loose,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And each, obedient, to his bench repair’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime Telemachus his sandals bound,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And lifted from the deck his glitt’ring spear.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, as Telemachus had bidden them,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Son of divine Ulysses, casting loose <span class="linenum"><a name="BXV_l670" id="BXV_l670"></a>670</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The hawsers, forth they push’d into the Deep<br></span>
<span class="i0">And sought the city, while with nimble pace<br></span>
<span class="i0">Proceeding thence, Telemachus attain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The cottage soon where good Eumæus slept,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The swine-herd, faithful to his num’rous charge.<br></span>

Iphyclus the son of Phylacus had seized and detained cattle
belonging to Neleus; Neleus ordered his nephew Melampus to recover them,
and as security for his obedience seized on a considerable part of his
possessions. Melampus attempted the service, failed, and was cast into
prison; but at length escaping, accomplished his errand, vanquished
Neleus in battle, and carried off his daughter Pero, whom Neleus had
promised to the brother of Melampus, but had afterward refused her.</p>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">Telemachus dispatches Eumæus to the city to inform Penelope of his safe
return from Pylus; during his absence, Ulysses makes himself known to his
son. The suitors, having watched for Telemachus in vain, arrive again at
Ithaca.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was the hour of dawn, when in the cot<br></span>
<span class="i0">Kindling fresh fire, Ulysses and his friend<br></span>
<span class="i0">Noble Eumæus dress’d their morning fare,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And sent the herdsmen with the swine abroad.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing Telemachus, the watchful dogs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bark’d not, but fawn’d around him. At that sight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And at the sound of feet which now approach’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses in wing’d accents thus remark’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Eumæus! certain, either friend of thine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is nigh at hand, or one whom well thou know’st; <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l10" id="BXVI_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy dogs bark not, but fawn on his approach<br></span>
<span class="i0">Obsequious, and the sound of feet I hear.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Scarce had he ceased, when his own son himself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stood in the vestibule. Upsprang at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eumæus wonder-struck, and from his hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Let fall the cups with which he was employ’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mingling rich wine; to his young Lord he ran,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His forehead kiss’d, kiss’d his bright-beaming eyes<br></span>
<span class="i0">And both his hands, weeping profuse the while,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As when a father folds in his embrace <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l20" id="BXVI_l20"></a>20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Arrived from foreign lands in the tenth year<br></span>
<span class="i0">His darling son, the offspring of his age,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His only one, for whom he long hath mourn’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So kiss’d the noble peasant o’er and o’er<br></span>
<span class="i0">Godlike Telemachus, as from death escaped,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in wing’d accents plaintive thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Light of my eyes, thou com’st; it is thyself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sweetest Telemachus! I had no hope<br></span>
<span class="i0">To see thee more, once told that o’er the Deep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hadst departed for the Pylian coast. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l30" id="BXVI_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Enter, my precious son; that I may sooth<br></span>
<span class="i0">My soul with sight of thee from far arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For seldom thou thy feeders and thy farm<br></span>
<span class="i0">Visitest, in the city custom’d much<br></span>
<span class="i0">To make abode, that thou may’st witness there<br></span>
<span class="i0">The manners of those hungry suitors proud.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It will be so. There is great need, my friend!<br></span>
<span class="i0">But here, for thy sake, have I now arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That I may look on thee, and from thy lips <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l40" id="BXVI_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Learn if my mother still reside at home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or have become spouse of some other Chief,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving untenanted Ulysses’ bed<br></span>
<span class="i0">To be by noisome spiders webb’d around.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom the master swine-herd in return.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not so, she, patient still as ever, dwells<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath thy roof, but all her cheerless days<br></span>
<span class="i0">Despairing wastes, and all her nights in tears.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, Eumæus at his hand received<br></span>
<span class="i0">His brazen lance, and o’er the step of stone <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l50" id="BXVI_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Enter’d Telemachus, to whom his sire<br></span>
<span class="i0">Relinquish’d, soon as he appear’d, his seat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But him Telemachus forbidding, said—<br></span>
<span class="i1">Guest, keep thy seat; our cottage will afford<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some other, which Eumæus will provide.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceased, and he, returning at the word,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reposed again; then good Eumæus spread<br></span>
<span class="i0">Green twigs beneath, which, cover’d with a fleece,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Supplied Ulysses’ offspring with a seat.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He, next, disposed his dishes on the board <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l60" id="BXVI_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With relicts charged of yesterday; with bread,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alert, he heap’d the baskets; with rich wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">His ivy cup replenish’d; and a seat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Took opposite to his illustrious Lord<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses. They toward the plenteous feast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stretch’d forth their hands, (and hunger now and thirst<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both satisfied) Telemachus, his speech<br></span>
<span class="i0">Addressing to their gen’rous host, began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Whence is this guest, my father? How convey’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Came he to Ithaca? What country boast <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l70" id="BXVI_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The mariners with whom he here arrived?<br></span>
<span class="i0">For, that on foot he found us not, is sure.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Eumæus, thou didst thus reply.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will with truth answer thee, O my son!<br></span>
<span class="i0">He boasts him sprung from ancestry renown’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">In spacious Crete, and hath the cities seen<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of various lands, by fate ordain’d to roam.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ev’n now, from a Thesprotian ship escaped,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He reach’d my cottage—but he is thy own;<br></span>
<span class="i0">I yield him to thee; treat him as thou wilt; <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l80" id="BXVI_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">He is thy suppliant, and depends on thee.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then thus, Telemachus, discrete, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy words, Eumæus, pain my very soul.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For what security can I afford<br></span>
<span class="i0">To any in my house? myself am young,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet of strength sufficient to repel<br></span>
<span class="i0">An offer’d insult, and my mother’s mind<br></span>
<span class="i0">In doubtful balance hangs, if, still with me<br></span>
<span class="i0">An inmate, she shall manage my concerns,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attentive only to her absent Lord <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l90" id="BXVI_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And her own good report, or shall espouse<br></span>
<span class="i0">The noblest of her wooers, and the best<br></span>
<span class="i0">Entitled by the splendour of his gifts.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But I will give him, since I find him lodg’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">A guest beneath thy roof, tunic and cloak,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sword double-edged, and sandals for his feet,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With convoy to the country of his choice.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Still, if it please thee, keep him here thy guest,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I will send him raiment, with supplies<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all sorts, lest he burthen thee and thine. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l100" id="BXVI_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But where the suitors come, there shall not he<br></span>
<span class="i0">With my consent, nor stand exposed to pride<br></span>
<span class="i0">And petulance like theirs, lest by some sneer<br></span>
<span class="i0">They wound him, and through him, wound also me;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For little is it that the boldest can<br></span>
<span class="i0">Against so many; numbers will prevail.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d then Ulysses toil-inured.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh amiable and good! since even I<br></span>
<span class="i0">Am free to answer thee, I will avow<br></span>
<span class="i0">My heart within me torn by what I hear <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l110" id="BXVI_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of those injurious suitors, who the house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Infest of one noble as thou appear’st.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But say—submittest thou to their controul<br></span>
<span class="i0">Willingly, or because the people, sway’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">By some response oracular, incline<br></span>
<span class="i0">Against thee? Thou hast brothers, it may chance,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slow to assist thee—for a brother’s aid<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is of importance in whatever cause.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For oh that I had youth as I have will,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or that renown’d Ulysses were my sire, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l120" id="BXVI_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Or that himself might wander home again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whereof hope yet remains! then might I lose<br></span>
<span class="i0">My head, that moment, by an alien’s hand,<br></span>
<span class="i0">If I would fail, ent’ring Ulysses’ gate,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To be the bane and mischief of them all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But if alone to multitudes opposed<br></span>
<span class="i0">I should perchance be foiled; nobler it were<br></span>
<span class="i0">With my own people, under my own roof<br></span>
<span class="i0">To perish, than to witness evermore<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their unexampled deeds, guests shoved aside, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l130" id="BXVI_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Maidens dragg’d forcibly from room to room,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Casks emptied of their rich contents, and them<br></span>
<span class="i0">Indulging glutt’nous appetite day by day<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enormous, without measure, without end.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom, Telemachus, discrete, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stranger! thy questions shall from me receive<br></span>
<span class="i0">True answer. Enmity or hatred none<br></span>
<span class="i0">Subsists the people and myself between,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor have I brothers to accuse, whose aid<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is of importance in whatever cause, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l140" id="BXVI_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For Jove hath from of old with single heirs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our house supplied; Arcesias none begat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Except Laertes, and Laertes none<br></span>
<span class="i0">Except Ulysses, and Ulysses me<br></span>
<span class="i0">Left here his only one, and unenjoy’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thence comes it that our palace swarms with foes;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For all the rulers of the neighbour isles,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Samos, Dulichium, and the forest-crown’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Zacynthus, others also rulers here<br></span>
<span class="i0">In craggy Ithaca, my mother seek <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l150" id="BXVI_l150"></a>150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In marriage, and my household stores consume.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But neither she those nuptial rites abhorr’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Refuses absolute, nor yet consents<br></span>
<span class="i0">To end them; they my patrimony waste<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, and will destroy me also soon,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As I expect, but heav’n disposes all.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Eumæus! haste, my father! bear with speed<br></span>
<span class="i0">News to Penelope that I am safe,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And have arrived from Pylus; I will wait<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till thou return; and well beware that none <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l160" id="BXVI_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Hear thee beside, for I have many foes.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Eumæus, thou didst thus reply.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It is enough. I understand. Thou speak’st<br></span>
<span class="i0">To one intelligent. But say beside,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I not also, as I go, inform<br></span>
<span class="i0">Distress’d Laertes? who while yet he mourn’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses only, could o’ersee the works,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And dieted among his menials oft<br></span>
<span class="i0">As hunger prompted him, but now, they say,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Since thy departure to the Pylian shore, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l170" id="BXVI_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">He neither eats as he was wont, nor drinks,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor oversees his hinds, but sighing sits<br></span>
<span class="i0">And weeping, wasted even to the bone.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him then Telemachus answer’d discrete.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hard though it be, yet to his tears and sighs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Him leave we now. We cannot what we would.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For, were the ordering of all events<br></span>
<span class="i0">Referr’d to our own choice, our first desire<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should be to see my father’s glad return.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But once thy tidings told, wander not thou <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l180" id="BXVI_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In quest of Him, but hither speed again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rather request my mother that she send<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her household’s governess without delay<br></span>
<span class="i0">Privately to him; she shall best inform<br></span>
<span class="i0">The ancient King that I have safe arrived.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and urged him forth, who binding on<br></span>
<span class="i0">His sandals, to the city bent his way.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor went Eumæus from his home unmark’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">By Pallas, who in semblance of a fair<br></span>
<span class="i0">Damsel, accomplish’d in domestic arts, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l190" id="BXVI_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Approaching to the cottage’ entrance, stood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Opposite, by Ulysses plain discern’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But to his son invisible; for the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Appear not manifest alike to all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The mastiffs saw her also, and with tone<br></span>
<span class="i0">Querulous hid themselves, yet bark’d they not.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She beckon’d him abroad. Ulysses saw<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sign, and, issuing through the outer court,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Approach’d her, whom the Goddess thus bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Laertes’ progeny, for wiles renown’d! <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l200" id="BXVI_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Disclose thyself to thy own son, that, death<br></span>
<span class="i0">Concerting and destruction to your foes,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ye may the royal city seek, nor long<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall ye my presence there desire in vain,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For I am ardent to begin the fight.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Minerva spake, and with her rod of gold<br></span>
<span class="i0">Touch’d him; his mantle, first, and vest she made<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pure as new-blanch’d; dilating, next, his form,<br></span>
<span class="i0">She gave dimensions ampler to his limbs;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Swarthy again his manly hue became, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l210" id="BXVI_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Round his full face, and black his bushy chin.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The change perform’d, Minerva disappear’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the illustrious Hero turn’d again<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into the cottage; wonder at that sight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seiz’d on Telemachus; askance he look’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Awe-struck, not unsuspicious of a God,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in wing’d accents eager thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thou art no longer, whom I lately saw,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor are thy cloaths, nor is thy port the same.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art a God, I know, and dwell’st in heav’n. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l220" id="BXVI_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, smile on us, that we may yield thee rites<br></span>
<span class="i0">Acceptable, and present thee golden gifts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Elaborate; ah spare us, Pow’r divine!<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, Hero toil-inured.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I am no God. Why deem’st thou me divine?<br></span>
<span class="i0">I am thy father, for whose sake thou lead’st<br></span>
<span class="i0">A life of woe, by violence oppress’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he kiss’d his son, while from his cheeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tears trickled, tears till then, perforce restrained.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus, (for he believed him not <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l230" id="BXVI_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His father yet) thus, wond’ring, spake again.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My father, said’st thou? no. Thou art not He,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But some Divinity beguiles my soul<br></span>
<span class="i0">With mock’ries to afflict me still the more;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For never mortal man could so have wrought<br></span>
<span class="i0">By his own pow’r; some interposing God<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alone could render thee both young and old,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For old thou wast of late, and foully clad,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But wear’st the semblance, now, of those in heav’n!<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l240" id="BXVI_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus! it is not well, my son!<br></span>
<span class="i0">That thou should’st greet thy father with a face<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of wild astonishment, and stand aghast.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, save myself, none comes, be sure.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such as thou seest, after ten thousand woes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which I have borne, I visit once again<br></span>
<span class="i0">My native country in the twentieth year.<br></span>
<span class="i0">This wonder Athenæan Pallas wrought,<br></span>
<span class="i0">She cloath’d me even with what form she would,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For so she can. Now poor I seem and old, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l250" id="BXVI_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Now young again, and clad in fresh attire.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Gods who dwell in yonder heav’n, with ease<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dignify or debase a mortal man.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he sat. Then threw Telemachus<br></span>
<span class="i0">His arms around his father’s neck, and wept.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Desire intense of lamentation seized<br></span>
<span class="i0">On both; soft murmurs utt’ring, each indulged<br></span>
<span class="i0">His grief, more frequent wailing than the bird,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Eagle, or hook-nail’d vulture) from whose nest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some swain hath stol’n her yet unfeather’d young. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l260" id="BXVI_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">So from their eyelids they big drops distill’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of tend’rest grief, nor had the setting sun<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cessation of their weeping seen, had not<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus his father thus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">What ship convey’d thee to thy native shore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My father! and what country boast the crew?<br></span>
<span class="i0">For, that on foot thou not arriv’dst, is sure.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then thus divine Ulysses toil-inured.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My son! I will explicit all relate.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Conducted by Phæacia’s maritime sons <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l270" id="BXVI_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I came, a race accustom’d to convey<br></span>
<span class="i0">Strangers who visit them across the Deep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Me, o’er the billows in a rapid bark<br></span>
<span class="i0">Borne sleeping, on the shores of Ithaca<br></span>
<span class="i0">They lay’d; rich gifts they gave me also, brass,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gold in full bags, and beautiful attire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which, warn’d from heav’n, I have in caves conceal’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">By Pallas prompted, hither I repair’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">That we might plan the slaughter of our foes,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose numbers tell me now, that I may know <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l280" id="BXVI_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">How pow’rful, certainly, and who they are,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And consultation with my dauntless heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">May hold, if we be able to contend<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ourselves with all, or must have aid beside.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then, answer thus his son, discrete, return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My father! thy renown hath ever rung<br></span>
<span class="i0">In thy son’s ears, and by report thy force<br></span>
<span class="i0">In arms, and wisdom I have oft been told.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But terribly thou speak’st; amazement-fixt<br></span>
<span class="i0">I hear; can two a multitude oppose, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l290" id="BXVI_l290"></a>290</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And valiant warriors all? for neither ten<br></span>
<span class="i0">Are they, nor twenty, but more num’rous far.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Learn, now, their numbers. Fifty youths and two<br></span>
<span class="i0">Came from Dulichium; they are chosen men,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And six attendants follow in their train;<br></span>
<span class="i0">From Samos twenty youths and four arrive,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Zacynthus also of Achaia’s sons<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sends twenty more, and our own island adds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Herself, her twelve chief rulers; Medon, too,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is there the herald, and the bard divine, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l300" id="BXVI_l300"></a>300</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With other two, intendants of the board.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should we within the palace, we alone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Assail them all, I fear lest thy revenge<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unpleasant to thyself and deadly prove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Frustrating thy return. But recollect—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Think, if thou canst, on whose confed’rate arm<br></span>
<span class="i0">Strenuous on our behalf we may rely.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To him replied his patient father bold.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will inform thee. Mark. Weigh well my words.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will Pallas and the everlasting Sire <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l310" id="BXVI_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Alone suffice? or need we other aids?<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer thus Telemachus return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Good friends indeed are they whom thou hast named,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Though throned above the clouds; for their controul<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is universal both in earth and heav’n.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, toil-worn Chief renown’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not long will they from battle stand aloof,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When once, within my palace, in the strength<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Mars, to sharp decision we shall urge<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors. But thyself at early dawn <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l320" id="BXVI_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Our mansion seek, that thou may’st mingle there<br></span>
<span class="i0">With that imperious throng; me in due time<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eumæus to the city shall conduct,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In form a miserable beggar old.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But should they with dishonourable scorn<br></span>
<span class="i0">Insult me, thou unmov’d my wrongs endure,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And should they even drag me by the feet<br></span>
<span class="i0">Abroad, or smite me with the spear, thy wrath<br></span>
<span class="i0">Refraining, gently counsel them to cease<br></span>
<span class="i0">From such extravagance; but well I know <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l330" id="BXVI_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That cease they will not, for their hour is come.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And mark me well; treasure what now I say<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in thy soul. When Pallas shall, herself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Suggest the measure, then, shaking my brows,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will admonish thee; thou, at the sign,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Remove what arms soever in the hall<br></span>
<span class="i0">Remain, and in the upper palace safe<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dispose them; should the suitors, missing them,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance interrogate thee, then reply<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gently—I have removed them from the smoke; <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l340" id="BXVI_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For they appear no more the arms which erst<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, going hence to Ilium, left,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But smirch’d and sullied by the breath of fire.<br></span>
<span class="i0">This weightier reason (thou shalt also say)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Jove taught me; lest, intoxicate with wine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ye should assault each other in your brawls,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shaming both feast and courtship; for the view<br></span>
<span class="i0">Itself of arms incites to their abuse.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet leave two faulchions for ourselves alone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Two spears, two bucklers, which with sudden force <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l350" id="BXVI_l350"></a>350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Impetuous we will seize, and Jove all-wise<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their valour shall, and Pallas, steal away.<br></span>
<span class="i0">This word store also in remembrance deep—<br></span>
<span class="i0">If mine in truth thou art, and of my blood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, of Ulysses to his home returned<br></span>
<span class="i0">Let none hear news from thee, no, not my sire<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laertes, nor Eumæus, nor of all<br></span>
<span class="i0">The menials any, or ev’n Penelope,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That thou and I, alone, may search the drift<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of our domestic women, and may prove <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l360" id="BXVI_l360"></a>360</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Our serving-men, who honours and reveres<br></span>
<span class="i0">And who contemns us both, but chiefly thee<br></span>
<span class="i0">So gracious and so worthy to be loved.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him then thus answer’d his illustrious son.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Trust me, my father! thou shalt soon be taught<br></span>
<span class="i0">That I am not of drowsy mind obtuse.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But this I think not likely to avail<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or thee or me; ponder it yet again;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For tedious were the task, farm after farm<br></span>
<span class="i0">To visit of those servants, proving each, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l370" id="BXVI_l370"></a>370</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And the proud suitors merciless devour<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime thy substance, nor abstain from aught.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Learn, if thou wilt, (and I that course myself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Advise) who slights thee of the female train,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And who is guiltless; but I would not try<br></span>
<span class="i0">From house to house the men, far better proved<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hereafter, if in truth by signs from heav’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">Inform’d, thou hast been taught the will of Jove.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus they conferr’d. The gallant bark, meantime,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reach’d Ithaca, which from the Pylian shore <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l380" id="BXVI_l380"></a>380</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Had brought Telemachus with all his band.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within the many-fathom’d port arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">His lusty followers haled her far aground,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then carried thence their arms, but to the house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Clytius the illustrious gifts convey’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Next to the royal mansion they dispatch’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">An herald charg’d with tidings to the Queen,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That her Telemachus had reach’d the cot<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of good Eumæus, and the bark had sent<br></span>
<span class="i0">Home to the city; lest the matchless dame <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l390" id="BXVI_l390"></a>390</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Should still deplore the absence of her son.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They, then, the herald and the swine-herd, each<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing like message to his mistress, met,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And at the palace of the godlike Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arriving, compass’d by the female throng<br></span>
<span class="i0">Inquisitive, the herald thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thy son, O Queen! is safe; ev’n now return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, drawing nigh to her, Eumæus told<br></span>
<span class="i0">His message also from her son received,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, his commission punctually discharged, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l400" id="BXVI_l400"></a>400</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving the palace, sought his home again.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Grief seized and anguish, at those tidings, all<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors; issuing forth, on the outside<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the high wall they sat, before the gate,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When Polybus’ son, Eurymachus, began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My friends! his arduous task, this voyage, deem’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">By us impossible, in our despight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus hath atchieved. Haste! launch we forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">A sable bark, our best, which let us man<br></span>
<span class="i0">With mariners expert, who, rowing forth <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l410" id="BXVI_l410"></a>410</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Swiftly, shall summon our companions home.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Scarce had he said, when turning where he sat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amphinomus beheld a bark arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">Just then in port; he saw them furling sail,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And seated with their oars in hand; he laugh’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Through pleasure at that sight, and thus he spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Our message may be spared. Lo! they arrive.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Either some God inform’d them, or they saw,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Themselves, the vessel of Telemachus<br></span>
<span class="i0">Too swiftly passing to be reach’d by theirs. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l420" id="BXVI_l420"></a>420</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake; they, rising, hasted to the shore.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alert they drew the sable bark aground,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And by his servant each his arms dispatch’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To his own home. Then, all, to council those<br></span>
<span class="i0">Assembling, neither elder of the land<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor youth allow’d to join them, and the rest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eupithes’ son, Antinoüs, thus bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ah! how the Gods have rescued him! all day<br></span>
<span class="i0">Perch’d on the airy mountain-top, our spies<br></span>
<span class="i0">Successive watch’d; and, when the sun declined, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l430" id="BXVI_l430"></a>430</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">We never slept on shore, but all night long<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till sacred dawn arose, plow’d the abyss,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hoping Telemachus, that we might seize<br></span>
<span class="i0">And slay him, whom some Deity hath led,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In our despight, safe to his home again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But frame we yet again means to destroy<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus; ah—let not Him escape!<br></span>
<span class="i0">For end of this our task, while he survives,<br></span>
<span class="i0">None shall be found, such prudence he displays<br></span>
<span class="i0">And wisdom, neither are the people now <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l440" id="BXVI_l440"></a>440</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Unanimous our friends as heretofore.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Come, then—prevent him, ere he call the Greeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">To council; for he will not long delay,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But will be angry, doubtless, and will tell<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amid them all, how we in vain devised<br></span>
<span class="i0">His death, a deed which they will scarce applaud,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But will, perhaps, punish and drive us forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">From our own country to a distant land.—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Prevent him, therefore, quickly; in the field<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slay him, or on the road; so shall his wealth <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l450" id="BXVI_l450"></a>450</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And his possessions on ourselves devolve<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which we will share equally, but his house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall be the Queen’s, and his whom she shall wed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, if not so inclined, ye rather chuse<br></span>
<span class="i0">That he should live and occupy entire<br></span>
<span class="i0">His patrimony, then, no longer, here<br></span>
<span class="i0">Assembled, let us revel at his cost,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But let us all with spousal gifts produced<br></span>
<span class="i0">From our respective treasures, woo the Queen,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving her in full freedom to espouse <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l460" id="BXVI_l460"></a>460</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Who proffers most, and whom the fates ordain.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceased; the assembly silent sat and mute.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then rose Amphinomus amid them all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Offspring renown’d of Nisus, son, himself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of King Aretias. He had thither led<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitor train who from the pleasant isle<br></span>
<span class="i0">Corn-clad of green Dulichium had arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And by his speech pleased far beyond them all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Penelope, for he was just and wise,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thus, well-counselling the rest, began. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l470" id="BXVI_l470"></a>470</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Not I, my friends! far be the thought from me<br></span>
<span class="i0">To slay Telemachus! it were a deed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Momentous, terrible, to slay a prince.<br></span>
<span class="i0">First, therefore, let us counsel ask of heav’n,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And if Jove’s oracle that course approve,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will encourage you, and will myself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Be active in his death; but if the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forbid it, then, by my advice, forbear.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake Amphinomus, whom all approved.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arising then, into Ulysses’ house <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l480" id="BXVI_l480"></a>480</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">They went, where each his splendid seat resumed.<br></span>
<span class="i1">A novel purpose occupied, meantime,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Penelope; she purposed to appear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before her suitors, whose design to slay<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus she had from Medon learn’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The herald, for his ear had caught the sound.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Toward the hall with her attendant train<br></span>
<span class="i0">She moved, and when, most graceful of her sex,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where sat the suitors she arrived, between<br></span>
<span class="i0">The columns standing of the stately dome, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l490" id="BXVI_l490"></a>490</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And covering with her white veil’s lucid folds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her features, to Antinoüs thus she spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Antinoüs, proud, contentious, evermore<br></span>
<span class="i0">To mischief prone! the people deem thee wise<br></span>
<span class="i0">Past thy compeers, and in all grace of speech<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pre-eminent, but such wast never thou.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Inhuman! why is it thy dark design<br></span>
<span class="i0">To slay Telemachus? and why with scorn<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rejectest thou the suppliant’s pray’r,<a name="fnm_72" id="fnm_72"></a><a href="#fn_72" class="fnnum">72</a> which Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself hath witness’d? Plots please not the Gods. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l500" id="BXVI_l500"></a>500</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Know’st not that thy own father refuge found<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here, when he fled before the people’s wrath<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom he had irritated by a wrong<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which, with a band of Taphian robbers joined,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He offer’d to the Thesprots, our allies?<br></span>
<span class="i0">They would have torn his heart, and would have laid<br></span>
<span class="i0">All his delights and his possessions waste,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But my Ulysses slaked the furious heat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of their revenge, whom thou requitest now<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wasting his goods, soliciting his wife, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l510" id="BXVI_l510"></a>510</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Slaying his son, and filling me with woe.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But cease, I charge thee, and bid cease the rest.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom the son of Polybus replied,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eurymachus.—Icarius’ daughter wise!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Take courage, fair Penelope, and chace<br></span>
<span class="i0">These fears unreasonable from thy mind!<br></span>
<span class="i0">The man lives not, nor shall, who while I live,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And faculty of sight retain, shall harm<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus, thy son. For thus I say,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thus will I perform; his blood shall stream <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l520" id="BXVI_l520"></a>520</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A sable current from my lance’s point<br></span>
<span class="i0">That moment; for the city-waster Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, oft, me placing on his knees,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath fill’d my infant grasp with sav’ry food,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And giv’n me ruddy wine. I, therefore, hold<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus of all men most my friend,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor hath he death to fear from hand of ours.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, if the Gods shall doom him, die he must.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So he encouraged her, who yet, himself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Plotted his death. She, re-ascending, sought <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l530" id="BXVI_l530"></a>530</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Her stately chamber, and, arriving there,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deplored with tears her long-regretted Lord<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till Athenæan Pallas azure-eyed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dews of soft slumber o’er her lids diffused.<br></span>
<span class="i1">And now, at even-tide, Eumæus reach’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses and his son. A yearling swine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Just slain they skilfully for food prepared,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When Pallas, drawing nigh, smote with her wand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, at the stroke rend’ring him old,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And his apparel sordid as before, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l540" id="BXVI_l540"></a>540</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Lest, knowing him, the swain at once should seek<br></span>
<span class="i0">Penelope, and let the secret forth.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then foremost him Telemachus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Noble Eumæus! thou art come; what news<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bring’st from the city? Have the warrior band<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of suitors, hopeless of their ambush, reach’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The port again, or wait they still for me?<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Eumæus, thou didst thus reply.<br></span>
<span class="i0">No time for such enquiry, nor to range,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Curious, the streets had I, but anxious wish’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l550" id="BXVI_l550"></a>550</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To make my message known, and to return.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, as it chanced, a nimble herald sent<br></span>
<span class="i0">From thy companions, met me on the way,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who reach’d thy mother first. Yet this I know,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For this I saw. Passing above the town<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where they have piled a way-side hill of stones<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Mercury, I beheld a gallant bark<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ent’ring the port; a bark she was of ours,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The crew were num’rous, and I mark’d her deep-<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laden with shields and spears of double edge. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVI_l560" id="BXVI_l560"></a>560</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Theirs I conjectured her, and could no more.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake, and by Eumæus unperceived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus his father eyed and smiled.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their task accomplish’d, and the table spread,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They ate, nor any his due portion miss’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And hunger, now, and thirst both sated, all<br></span>
<span class="i0">To rest repair’d, and took the gift of sleep.<br></span>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">Telemachus returns to the city, and relates to his mother the principal
passages of his voyage; Ulysses, conducted by Eumæus, arrives there also,
and enters among the suitors, having been known only by his old dog
Argus, who dies at his feet. The curiosity of Penelope being excited by
the account which Eumæus gives her of Ulysses, she orders him immediately
into her presence, but Ulysses postpones the interview till evening, when
the suitors having left the palace, there shall be no danger of
interruption. Eumæus returns to his cottage.</p>

<span class="i0">Till her own eyes behold me. But I lay <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l10" id="BXVII_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">On thee this charge. Into the city lead,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thyself, this hapless guest, that he may beg<br></span>
<span class="i0">Provision there, a morsel and a drop<br></span>
<span class="i0">From such as may, perchance, vouchsafe the boon.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot, vext and harass’d as I am,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Feed all, and should the stranger take offence,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The worse for him. Plain truth is my delight.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor is it my desire to be detained.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Better the mendicant in cities seeks <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l20" id="BXVII_l20"></a>20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His dole, vouchsafe it whosoever may,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Than in the villages. I am not young,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor longer of an age that well accords<br></span>
<span class="i0">With rural tasks, nor could I all perform<br></span>
<span class="i0">That it might please a master to command.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Go then, and when I shall have warm’d my limbs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before the hearth, and when the risen sun<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall somewhat chase the cold, thy servant’s task<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall be to guide me thither, as thou bidd’st,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For this is a vile garb; the frosty air <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l30" id="BXVII_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of morning would benumb me thus attired,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, as ye say, the city is remote.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, and Telemachus in haste<br></span>
<span class="i0">Set forth, his thoughts all teeming as he went<br></span>
<span class="i0">With dire revenge. Soon in the palace-courts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arriving, he reclined his spear against<br></span>
<span class="i0">A column, and proceeded to the hall.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Him Euryclea, first, his nurse, perceived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">While on the variegated seats she spread<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their fleecy cov’ring; swift with tearful eyes <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l40" id="BXVII_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">She flew to him, and the whole female train<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of brave Ulysses swarm’d around his son,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Clasping him, and his forehead and his neck<br></span>
<span class="i0">Kissing affectionate; then came, herself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As golden Venus or Diana fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from her chamber to her son’s embrace,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The chaste Penelope; with tears she threw<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her arms around him, his bright-beaming eyes<br></span>
<span class="i0">And forehead kiss’d, and with a murmur’d plaint<br></span>
<span class="i0">Maternal, in wing’d accents thus began. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l50" id="BXVII_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Thou hast return’d, light of my eyes! my son!<br></span>
<span class="i0">My lov’d Telemachus! I had no hope<br></span>
<span class="i0">To see thee more when once thou hadst embark’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">For Pylus, privily, and with no consent<br></span>
<span class="i0">From me obtain’d, news seeking of thy sire.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But haste; unfold. Declare what thou hast seen.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ah mother! let my sorrows rest, nor me<br></span>
<span class="i0">From death so lately ’scaped afflict anew,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, bathed and habited in fresh attire, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l60" id="BXVII_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With all the maidens of thy train ascend<br></span>
<span class="i0">To thy superior chamber, there to vow<br></span>
<span class="i0">A perfect hecatomb to all the Gods,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When Jove shall have avenged our num’rous wrongs.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I seek the forum, there to introduce<br></span>
<span class="i0">A guest, my follower from the Pylian shore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom sending forward with my noble band,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I bade Piræus to his own abode<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lead him, and with all kindness entertain<br></span>
<span class="i0">The stranger, till I should myself arrive. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l70" id="BXVII_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake, nor flew his words useless away.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She, bathed and habited in fresh attire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Vow’d a full hecatomb to all the Gods,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Would Jove but recompense her num’rous wrongs.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, spear in hand, went forth her son, two dogs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fleet-footed following him. O’er all his form<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pallas diffused a dignity divine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And ev’ry eye gazed on him as he pass’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors throng’d him round, joy on their lips<br></span>
<span class="i0">And welcome, but deep mischief in their hearts. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l80" id="BXVII_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">He, shunning all that crowd, chose to himself<br></span>
<span class="i0">A seat, where Mentor sat, and Antiphus,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Halytherses, long his father’s friends<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sincere, who of his voyage much enquired.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then drew Piræus nigh, leading his guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Toward the forum; nor Telemachus<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stood long aloof, but greeted his approach,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And was accosted by Piræus thus.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Sir! send thy menial women to bring home<br></span>
<span class="i0">The precious charge committed to my care, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l90" id="BXVII_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy gifts at Menelaus’ hands received.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Piræus! wait; for I not yet foresee<br></span>
<span class="i0">The upshot. Should these haughty ones effect<br></span>
<span class="i0">My death, clandestine, under my own roof,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And parcel my inheritance by lot,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I rather wish those treasures thine, than theirs.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But should I with success plan for them all<br></span>
<span class="i0">A bloody death, then, wing’d with joy, thyself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bring home those presents to thy joyful friend. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l100" id="BXVII_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he led the anxious stranger thence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into the royal mansion, where arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Each cast his mantle on a couch or throne,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And plung’d his feet into a polish’d bath.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There wash’d and lubricated with smooth oils,<br></span>
<span class="i0">From the attendant maidens each received<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tunic and shaggy mantle. Thus attired,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from the baths they stepp’d, and sat again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">A maiden, next, with golden ewer charged,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And silver bowl, pour’d water on their hands, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l110" id="BXVII_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And spread the polish’d table, which with food<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all kinds, remnants of the last regale,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The mistress of the household charge supplied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, beside a column of the dome<br></span>
<span class="i0">His mother, on a couch reclining, twirl’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her slender threads. They to the furnish’d board<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stretch’d forth their hands, and, hunger now and thirst<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both satisfied, Penelope began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Telemachus! I will ascend again,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And will repose me on my woeful bed; <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l120" id="BXVII_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For such it hath been, and with tears of mine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ceaseless bedew’d, e’er since Ulysses went<br></span>
<span class="i0">With Atreus’ sons to Troy. For not a word<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou would’st vouchsafe me till our haughty guests<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had occupied the house again, of all<br></span>
<span class="i0">That thou hast heard (if aught indeed thou hast)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy long-absent father’s wish’d return.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Her answer’d then Telemachus discrete.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mother, at thy request I will with truth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Relate the whole. At Pylus shore arrived <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l130" id="BXVII_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">We Nestor found, Chief of the Pylian race.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Receiving me in his august abode,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He entertain’d me with such welcome kind<br></span>
<span class="i0">As a glad father shews to his own son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Long-lost and newly found; so Nestor me,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And his illustrious offspring, entertain’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But yet assured me that he nought had heard<br></span>
<span class="i0">From mortal lips of my magnanimous sire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whether alive or dead; with his own steeds<br></span>
<span class="i0">He sent me, and with splendid chariot thence <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l140" id="BXVII_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To spear-famed Menelaus, Atreus’ son.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There saw I Helen, by the Gods’ decree<br></span>
<span class="i0">Auth’ress of trouble both to Greece and Troy.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Hero Menelaus then enquired<br></span>
<span class="i0">What cause had urged me to the pleasant vale<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Lacedæmon; plainly I rehearsed<br></span>
<span class="i0">The occasion, and the Hero thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ye Gods! they are ambitious of the bed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of a brave man, however base themselves.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, as it chances when the hart hath laid <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l150" id="BXVII_l150"></a>150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Her fawns new-yean’d and sucklings yet, to rest<br></span>
<span class="i0">In some resistless lion’s den, she roams,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, the hills, and in the grassy vales<br></span>
<span class="i0">Feeds heedless, but the lion to his lair<br></span>
<span class="i0">Returning soon, both her and hers destroys,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So shall thy father, brave Ulysses, them.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Jove! Pallas! and Apollo! oh that such<br></span>
<span class="i0">As erst in well-built Lesbos, where he strove<br></span>
<span class="i0">With Philomelides, whom wrestling, flat<br></span>
<span class="i0">He threw, when all Achaia’s sons rejoiced, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l160" id="BXVII_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, now, might mingle with his foes!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Short life and bitter nuptials should be theirs,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But thy enquiries neither indirect<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will I evade, nor give thee false reply,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But all that from the Ancient of the Deep<a name="fnm_73" id="fnm_73"></a><a href="#fn_73" class="fnnum">73</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">I have received will utter, hiding nought.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The God declared that he had seen thy sire<br></span>
<span class="i0">In a lone island, sorrowing, and detain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">An inmate in the grotto of the nymph<br></span>
<span class="i0">Calypso, wanting also means by which <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l170" id="BXVII_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To reach the country of his birth again,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For neither gallant barks nor friends had he<br></span>
<span class="i0">To speed his passage o’er the boundless waves.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So Menelaus spake, the spear-renown’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My errand thus accomplish’d, I return’d—<br></span>
<span class="i0">And by the Gods with gales propitious blest,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was wafted swiftly to my native shore.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake, and tumult in his mother’s heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">So speaking, raised. Consolatory, next,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The godlike Theoclymenus began. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l180" id="BXVII_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Consort revered of Laertiades!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Little the Spartan knew, but list to me,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For I will plainly prophesy and sure.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Be Jove of all in heav’n my witness first,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then this thy hospitable board, and, last,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The household Gods of the illustrious Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, at whose hearth I have arrived,<a name="fnm_74" id="fnm_74"></a><a href="#fn_74" class="fnnum">74</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">That, even now, within his native isle<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses somewhere sits, or creeps obscure,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Witness of these enormities, and seeds <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l190" id="BXVII_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Sowing of dire destruction for his foes;<br></span>
<span class="i0">So sure an augury, while on the deck<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reclining of the gallant bark, I saw,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with loud voice proclaim’d it to thy son.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d then Penelope discrete.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grant heav’n, my guest, that this good word of thine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fail not! then shalt thou soon such bounty share<br></span>
<span class="i0">And friendship at my hands, that at first sight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whoe’er shall meet thee shall pronounce thee blest.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus they conferr’d. Meantime the suitors hurl’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l200" id="BXVII_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The quoit and lance on the smooth area spread<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before Ulysses’ gate, the custom’d scene<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of their contentions, sports, and clamours rude.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when the hour of supper now approach’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And from the pastures on all sides the sheep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Came with their wonted drivers, Medon then<br></span>
<span class="i0">(For he of all the heralds pleas’d them most,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And waited at the board) them thus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Enough of play, young princes! ent’ring now<br></span>
<span class="i0">The house, prepare we sedulous our feast, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l210" id="BXVII_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Since in well-timed refreshment harm is none.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake, whose admonition pleas’d. At once<br></span>
<span class="i0">All, rising, sought the palace; there arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Each cast his mantle off, which on his throne<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or couch he spread, then, brisk, to slaughter fell<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of many a victim; sheep and goats and brawns<br></span>
<span class="i0">They slew, all fatted, and a pastur’d ox,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hast’ning the banquet; nor with less dispatch<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses and Eumæus now prepared<br></span>
<span class="i0">To seek the town, when thus the swain began. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l220" id="BXVII_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">My guest! since thy fixt purpose is to seek<br></span>
<span class="i0">This day the city as my master bade,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Though I, in truth, much rather wish thee here<br></span>
<span class="i0">A keeper of our herds, yet, through respect<br></span>
<span class="i0">And rev’rence of his orders, whose reproof<br></span>
<span class="i0">I dread, for masters seldom gently chide,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I would be gone. Arise, let us depart,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For day already is far-spent, and soon<br></span>
<span class="i0">The air of even-tide will chill thee more.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l230" id="BXVII_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">It is enough. I understand. Thou speak’st<br></span>
<span class="i0">To one intelligent. Let us depart,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And lead, thyself, the way; but give me, first,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(If thou have one already hewn) a staff<br></span>
<span class="i0">To lean on, for ye have described the road<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rugged, and ofttimes dang’rous to the foot.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, his tatter’d wallet o’er his back<br></span>
<span class="i0">He cast, suspended by a leathern twist,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eumæus gratified him with a staff,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And forth they went, leaving the cottage kept <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l240" id="BXVII_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">By dogs and swains. He city-ward his King<br></span>
<span class="i0">Led on, in form a squalid beggar old,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Halting, and in unseemly garb attired.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when, slow-travelling the craggy way,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They now approach’d the town, and had attain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The marble fountain deep, which with its streams<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pellucid all the citizens supplied,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Ithacus had that fountain framed of old<br></span>
<span class="i0">With Neritus and Polyctor, over which<br></span>
<span class="i0">A grove of water-nourish’d alders hung <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l250" id="BXVII_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Circular on all sides, while cold the rill<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ran from the rock, on whose tall summit stood<br></span>
<span class="i0">The altar of the nymphs, by all who pass’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With sacrifice frequented, still, and pray’r)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Melantheus, son of Dolius, at that fount<br></span>
<span class="i0">Met them; the chosen goats of ev’ry flock,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With two assistants, from the field he drove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors’ supper. He, seeing them both,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In surly accent boorish, such as fired<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses with resentment, thus began. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l260" id="BXVII_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Ay—this is well—The villain leads the vile—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus evermore the Gods join like to like.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou clumsy swine-herd, whither would’st conduct<br></span>
<span class="i0">This morsel-hunting mendicant obscene,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Defiler base of banquets? many a post<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall he rub smooth that props him while he begs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lean alms, sole object of his low pursuit,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who ne’er to sword or tripod yet aspired.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Would’st thou afford him to me for a guard<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or sweeper of my stalls, or to supply <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l270" id="BXVII_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">My kids with leaves, he should on bulkier thewes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Supported stand, though nourish’d but with whey.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But no such useful arts hath he acquired,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor likes he work, but rather much to extort<br></span>
<span class="i0">From others food for his unsated maw.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But mark my prophecy, for it is true,<br></span>
<span class="i0">At famed Ulysses’ house should he arrive,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His sides shall shatter many a footstool hurl’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Against them by the offended princes there.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake, and drawing nigh, with his rais’d foot, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l280" id="BXVII_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Insolent as he was and brutish, smote<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses’ haunch, yet shook not from his path<br></span>
<span class="i0">The firm-set Chief, who, doubtful, mused awhile<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whether to rush on him, and with his staff<br></span>
<span class="i0">To slay him, or uplifting him on high,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Downward to dash him headlong; but his wrath<br></span>
<span class="i0">Restraining, calm he suffer’d the affront.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Him then Eumæus with indignant look<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rebuking, rais’d his hands, and fervent pray’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Nymphs of the fountains, progeny of Jove! <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l290" id="BXVII_l290"></a>290</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">If e’er Ulysses on your altar burn’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The thighs of fatted lambs or kidlings, grant<br></span>
<span class="i0">This my request. O let the Hero soon,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Conducted by some Deity, return!<br></span>
<span class="i0">So shall he quell that arrogance which safe<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou now indulgest, roaming day by day<br></span>
<span class="i0">The city, while bad shepherds mar the flocks.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom the goat-herd answer thus return’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Melantheus. Marvellous! how rare a speech<br></span>

<span class="i0">Far hence at a convenient time on board<br></span>
<span class="i0">My bark, and sell him at no little gain.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I would, that he who bears the silver bow<br></span>
<span class="i0">As sure might pierce Telemachus this day<br></span>
<span class="i0">In his own house, or that the suitors might,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As that same wand’rer shall return no more!<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and them left pacing slow along,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But soon, himself, at his Lord’s house arrived;<br></span>
<span class="i0">There ent’ring bold, he with the suitors sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Opposite to Eurymachus, for him <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l310" id="BXVII_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">He valued most. The sewers his portion placed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of meat before him, and the maiden, chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Directress of the household gave him bread.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now, Ulysses, with the swain his friend<br></span>
<span class="i0">Approach’d, when, hearing the harmonious lyre,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both stood, for Phemius had begun his song.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He grasp’d the swine-herd’s hand, and thus he said.<br></span>
<span class="i1">This house, Eumæus! of Ulysses seems<br></span>
<span class="i0">Passing magnificent, and to be known<br></span>
<span class="i0">With ease for his among a thousand more. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l320" id="BXVII_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">One pile supports another, and a wall<br></span>
<span class="i0">Crested with battlements surrounds the court;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Firm, too, the folding doors all force of man<br></span>
<span class="i0">Defy; but num’rous guests, as I perceive,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now feast within; witness the sav’ry steam<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fast-fuming upward, and the sounding harp,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Divine associate of the festive board.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast well-guess’d; no wonder, thou art quick<br></span>
<span class="i0">On ev’ry theme; but let us well forecast <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l330" id="BXVII_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">This business. Wilt thou, ent’ring first, thyself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The splendid mansion, with the suitors mix,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Me leaving here? or shall I lead the way<br></span>
<span class="i0">While thou remain’st behind? yet linger not,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lest, seeing thee without, some servant strike<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or drive thee hence. Consider which were best.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d, then, the patient Hero bold.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It is enough. I understand. Thou speak’st<br></span>
<span class="i0">To one intelligent. Lead thou the way<br></span>
<span class="i0">Me leaving here, for neither stripes nor blows <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l340" id="BXVII_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To me are strange. Much exercised with pain<br></span>
<span class="i0">In fight and on the Deep, I have long since<br></span>
<span class="i0">Learn’d patience. Follow, next, what follow may!<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, to suppress the appetite, I deem<br></span>
<span class="i0">Impossible; the stomach is a source<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of ills to man, an avaricious gulph<br></span>
<span class="i0">Destructive, which to satiate, ships are rigg’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seas travers’d, and fierce battles waged remote.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus they discoursing stood; Argus the while,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses’ dog, uplifted where he lay <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l350" id="BXVII_l350"></a>350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His head and ears erect. Ulysses him<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had bred long since, himself, but rarely used,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Departing, first, to Ilium. Him the youths<br></span>
<span class="i0">In other days led frequent to the chace<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of wild goat, hart and hare; but now he lodg’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">A poor old cast-off, of his Lord forlorn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where mules and oxen had before the gate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Much ordure left, with which Ulysses’ hinds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should, in due time, manure his spacious fields.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There lay, with dog-devouring vermin foul <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l360" id="BXVII_l360"></a>360</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">All over, Argus; soon as he perceived<br></span>
<span class="i0">Long-lost Ulysses nigh, down fell his ears<br></span>
<span class="i0">Clapp’d close, and with his tail glad sign he gave<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of gratulation, impotent to rise<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to approach his master as of old.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, noting him, wiped off a tear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unmark’d, and of Eumæus quick enquired.<br></span>
<span class="i1">I can but wonder seeing such a dog<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus lodg’d, Eumæus! beautiful in form<br></span>
<span class="i0">He is, past doubt, but whether he hath been <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l370" id="BXVII_l370"></a>370</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">As fleet as fair I know not; rather such<br></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance as masters sometimes keep to grace<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their tables, nourish’d more for shew than use.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He is the dog of one dead far remote.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But had he now such feat-performing strength<br></span>
<span class="i0">As when Ulysses left him, going hence<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Ilium, in one moment thou shouldst mark,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Astonish’d, his agility and force.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He never in the sylvan deep recess <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l380" id="BXVII_l380"></a>380</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The wild beast saw that ’scaped him, and he track’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their steps infallible; but he hath now<br></span>
<span class="i0">No comfort, for (the master dead afar)<br></span>
<span class="i0">The heedless servants care not for his dog.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Domestics, missing once their Lord’s controul,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grow wilful, and refuse their proper tasks;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For whom Jove dooms to servitude, he takes<br></span>
<span class="i0">At once the half of that man’s worth away.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and, ent’ring at the portal, join’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors. Then his destiny released <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l390" id="BXVII_l390"></a>390</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Old Argus, soon as he had lived to see<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses in the twentieth year restored.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Godlike Telemachus, long ere the rest,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Marking the swine-herd’s entrance, with a nod<br></span>
<span class="i0">Summon’d him to approach. Eumæus cast<br></span>
<span class="i0">His eye around, and seeing vacant there<br></span>
<span class="i0">The seat which the dispenser of the feast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was wont to occupy while he supplied<br></span>
<span class="i0">The num’rous guests, planted it right before<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus, and at his table sat, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l400" id="BXVII_l400"></a>400</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">On which the herald placed for him his share<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of meat, and from the baskets gave him bread.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Soon after <i>him</i>, Ulysses enter’d slow<br></span>
<span class="i0">The palace, like a squalid beggar old,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Staff-propp’d, and in loose tatters foul attired.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within the portal on the ashen sill<br></span>
<span class="i0">He sat, and, seeming languid, lean’d against<br></span>
<span class="i0">A cypress pillar by the builder’s art<br></span>
<span class="i0">Polish’d long since, and planted at the door.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then took Telemachus a loaf entire <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l410" id="BXVII_l410"></a>410</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from the elegant basket, and of flesh<br></span>
<span class="i0">A portion large as his two hands contained,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, beck’ning close the swine-herd, charged him thus.<br></span>
<span class="i1">These to the stranger; whom advise to ask<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some dole from ev’ry suitor; bashful fear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ill suits the mendicant by want oppress’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake; Eumæus went, and where he sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arriving, in wing’d accents thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Telemachus, oh stranger, sends thee these,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And counsels thee to importune for more <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l420" id="BXVII_l420"></a>420</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors, one by one; for bashful fear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ill suits the mendicant by want oppress’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Jove, King of all, grant ev’ry good on earth<br></span>
<span class="i0">To kind Telemachus, and the complete<br></span>
<span class="i0">Accomplishment of all that he desires!<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and with both hands outspread, the mess<br></span>
<span class="i0">Receiving as he sat, on his worn bag<br></span>
<span class="i0">Disposed it at his feet. Long as the bard<br></span>
<span class="i0">Chaunted, he ate, and when he ceas’d to eat, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l430" id="BXVII_l430"></a>430</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then also ceas’d the bard divine to sing.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now ensued loud clamour in the hall<br></span>
<span class="i0">And tumult, when Minerva, drawing nigh<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Laertiades, impell’d the Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Crusts to collect, or any pittance small<br></span>
<span class="i0">At ev’ry suitor’s hand, for trial’s sake<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of just and unjust; yet deliv’rance none<br></span>
<span class="i0">From evil she design’d for any there.<br></span>
<span class="i0">From left to right<a name="fnm_75" id="fnm_75"></a><a href="#fn_75" class="fnnum">75</a> his progress he began<br></span>
<span class="i0">Petitioning, with outstretch’d hands, the throng, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l440" id="BXVII_l440"></a>440</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">As one familiar with the beggar’s art.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They, pitying, gave to him, but view’d him still<br></span>
<span class="i0">With wonder, and enquiries mutual made<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, and whence was he? Then the goat-herd rose<br></span>
<span class="i0">Melanthius, and th’ assembly thus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Hear me, ye suitors of th’ illustrious Queen!<br></span>
<span class="i0">This guest, of whom ye ask, I have beheld<br></span>
<span class="i0">Elsewhere; the swine-herd brought him; but himself<br></span>
<span class="i0">I know not, neither who nor whence he is.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So he; then thus Antinoüs stern rebuked <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l450" id="BXVII_l450"></a>450</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The swine-herd. Ah, notorious as thou art,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Why hast thou shewn this vagabond the way<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into the city? are we not enough<br></span>
<span class="i0">Infested with these troublers of our feasts?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deem’st it a trifle that such numbers eat<br></span>
<span class="i0">At thy Lord’s cost, and hast thou, therefore, led<br></span>
<span class="i0">This fellow hither, found we know not where?<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Antinoüs! though of high degree, thou speak’st<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not wisely. What man to another’s house <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l460" id="BXVII_l460"></a>460</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Repairs to invite him to a feast, unless<br></span>
<span class="i0">He be of those who by profession serve<br></span>
<span class="i0">The public, prophet, healer of disease,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ingenious artist, or some bard divine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose music may exhilarate the guests?<br></span>
<span class="i0">These, and such only, are in ev’ry land<br></span>
<span class="i0">Call’d to the banquet; none invites the poor,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who much consume, and no requital yield.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But thou of all the suitors roughly treat’st<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses’ servants most, and chiefly me; <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l470" id="BXVII_l470"></a>470</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet thee I heed not, while the virtuous Queen<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dwells in this palace, and her godlike son.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Peace! answer not verbose a man like him.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Antinoüs hath a tongue accustom’d much<br></span>
<span class="i0">To tauntings, and promotes them in the rest.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then, turning to Antinoüs, quick he said—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Antinoüs! as a father for his son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Takes thought, so thou for me, who bidd’st me chase<br></span>
<span class="i0">The stranger harshly hence; but God forbid!<a name="fnm_76" id="fnm_76"></a><a href="#fn_76" class="fnnum">76</a> <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l480" id="BXVII_l480"></a>480</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Impart to him. I grudge not, but myself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exhort thee to it; neither, in this cause,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fear thou the Queen, or in the least regard<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever menial throughout all the house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of famed Ulysses. Ah! within thy breast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dwells no such thought; thou lov’st not to impart<br></span>
<span class="i0">To others, but to gratify thyself.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Antinoüs answer thus return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">High-soaring and intemp’rate in thy speech<br></span>
<span class="i0">How hast thou said, Telemachus? Would all <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l490" id="BXVII_l490"></a>490</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">As much bestow on him, he should not seek<br></span>
<span class="i0">Admittance here again three months to come.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he seized the stool which, banqueting,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He press’d with his nice feet, and from beneath<br></span>
<span class="i0">The table forth advanced it into view.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The rest all gave to him, with bread and flesh<br></span>
<span class="i0">Filling his wallet, and Ulysses, now,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Returning to his threshold, there to taste<br></span>
<span class="i0">The bounty of the Greeks, paused in his way<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside Antinoüs, whom he thus address’d. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l500" id="BXVII_l500"></a>500</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Kind sir! vouchsafe to me! for thou appear’st<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not least, but greatest of the Achaians here,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And hast a kingly look. It might become<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thee therefore above others to bestow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So should I praise thee wheresoe’er I roam.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I also lived the happy owner once<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of such a stately mansion, and have giv’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">To num’rous wand’rers (whencesoe’er they <a class="correction" title="closing ) added" href="#tnotes">came)</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">All that they needed; I was also served<br></span>
<span class="i0">By many, and enjoy’d all that denotes <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l510" id="BXVII_l510"></a>510</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The envied owner opulent and blest.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But Jove (for so it pleas’d him) hath reduced<br></span>
<span class="i0">My all to nothing, prompting me, in league<br></span>
<span class="i0">With rovers of the Deep, to sail afar<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Ægypt, for my sure destruction there.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within th’ Ægyptian stream my barks well-oar’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">I station’d, and, enjoining strict my friends<br></span>
<span class="i0">To watch them close-attendant at their side,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Commanded spies into the hill-tops; but they,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Under the impulse of a spirit rash <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l520" id="BXVII_l520"></a>520</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And hot for quarrel, the well-cultur’d fields<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pillaged of the Ægyptians, captive led<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their wives and little-ones, and slew the men.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long, the loud alarm their city reach’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Down came the citizens, by dawn of day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With horse and foot and with the gleam of arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Filling the plain. Then Jove with panic dread<br></span>
<span class="i0">Struck all my people; none found courage more<br></span>
<span class="i0">To stand, for mischiefs swarm’d on ev’ry side.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There, num’rous by the glitt’ring spear we fell <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l530" id="BXVII_l530"></a>530</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Slaughter’d, while others they conducted thence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alive to servitude; but me they gave<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Dmetor, King in Cyprus, Jasus’ son;<br></span>
<span class="i0">He entertained me liberally, and thence<br></span>
<span class="i0">This land I reach’d, but poor and woe-begone.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer thus Antinoüs harsh return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">What dæmon introduced this nuisance here,<br></span>
<span class="i0">This troubler of our feast? stand yonder, keep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Due distance from my table, or expect<br></span>
<span class="i0">To see an Ægypt and a Cyprus worse <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l540" id="BXVII_l540"></a>540</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Than those, bold mendicant and void of shame!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hauntest each, and, inconsid’rate, each<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gives to thee, because gifts at other’s cost<br></span>
<span class="i0">Are cheap, and, plentifully serv’d themselves,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They squander, heedless, viands not their own.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses while he slow retired.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gods! how illib’ral with that specious form!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wouldst not grant the poor a grain of salt<br></span>
<span class="i0">From thy own board, who at another’s fed<br></span>
<span class="i0">So nobly, canst thou not spare a crust to me. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l550" id="BXVII_l550"></a>550</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake; then raged Antinoüs still the more,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in wing’d accents, louring, thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Take such dismission now as thou deserv’st,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Opprobrious! hast thou dared to scoff at me?<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he seized his stool, and on the joint<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of his right shoulder smote him; firm as rock<br></span>
<span class="i0">He stood, by no such force to be displaced,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But silent shook his brows, and dreadful deeds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of vengeance ruminating, sought again<br></span>
<span class="i0">His seat the threshold, where his bag full-charged <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l560" id="BXVII_l560"></a>560</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">He grounded, and the suitors thus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Hear now, ye suitors of the matchless Queen,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My bosom’s dictates. Trivial is the harm,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce felt, if, fighting for his own, his sheep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance, or beeves, a man receive a blow.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But me Antinoüs struck for that I ask’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Food from him merely to appease the pangs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of hunger, source of num’rous ills to man.<br></span>
<span class="i0">If then the poor man have a God t’ avenge<br></span>
<span class="i0">His wrongs, I pray to him that death may seize <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l570" id="BXVII_l570"></a>570</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Antinoüs, ere his nuptial hour arrive!<br></span>

<span class="i0">Son of Eupithes. Either seated there<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or going hence, eat, stranger, and be still;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lest for thy insolence, by hand or foot<br></span>
<span class="i0">We drag thee forth, and thou be flay’d alive.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceased, whom all indignant heard, and thus<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ev’n his own proud companions censured him.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Antinoüs! thou didst not well to smite<br></span>
<span class="i0">The wretched vagabond. O thou art doom’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l580" id="BXVII_l580"></a>580</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">But in his heart Telemachus that blow<br></span>
<span class="i0">Resented, anguish-torn, yet not a tear<br></span>
<span class="i0">He shed, but silent shook his brows, and mused<br></span>
<span class="i0">Terrible things. Penelope, meantime, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l590" id="BXVII_l590"></a>590</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">Thee also. Then Eurynome replied,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Oh might our pray’rs prevail, none of them all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should see bright-charioted Aurora more.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Her answer’d then Penelope discrete.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nurse! they are odious all, for that alike<br></span>
<span class="i0">All teem with mischief; but Antinoüs’ looks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Remind me ever of the gloom of death. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l600" id="BXVII_l600"></a>600</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A stranger hath arrived who, begging, roams<br></span>
<span class="i0">The house, (for so his penury enjoins)<br></span>
<span class="i0">The rest have giv’n him, and have fill’d his bag<br></span>
<span class="i0">With viands, but Antinoüs hath bruised<br></span>
<span class="i0">His shoulder with a foot-stool hurl’d at him.<br></span>
<span class="i1">While thus the Queen conversing with her train<br></span>
<span class="i0">In her own chamber sat, Ulysses made<br></span>
<span class="i0">Plenteous repast. Then, calling to her side<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eumæus, thus she signified her will.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Eumæus, noble friend! bid now approach <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l610" id="BXVII_l610"></a>610</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Yon stranger. I would speak with him, and ask<br></span>
<span class="i0">If he has seen Ulysses, or have heard<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tidings, perchance, of the afflicted Chief,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For much a wand’rer by his garb he seems.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Were those Achaians silent, thou shouldst hear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">O Queen! a tale that would console thy heart.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Three nights I housed him, and within my cot<br></span>
<span class="i0">Three days detain’d him, (for his ship he left<br></span>
<span class="i0">A fugitive, and came direct to me) <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l620" id="BXVII_l620"></a>620</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But half untold his hist’ry still remains.<br></span>
<span class="i0">As when his eye one fixes on a bard<br></span>
<span class="i0">From heav’n instructed in such themes as charm<br></span>
<span class="i0">The ear of mortals, ever as he sings<br></span>
<span class="i0">The people press, insatiable, to hear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So, in my cottage, seated at my side,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That stranger with his tale enchanted me.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laertes, he affirms, hath been his guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Erewhile in Crete, where Minos’ race resides,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thence he hath arrived, after great loss, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l630" id="BXVII_l630"></a>630</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A suppliant to the very earth abased;<br></span>
<span class="i0">He adds, that in Thesprotia’s neighbour realm<br></span>
<span class="i0">He of Ulysses heard, both that he lives,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And that he comes laden with riches home.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Penelope, discrete, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Haste; call him. I would hear, myself, his tale.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, let these, or in the palace gate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sport jocular, or here; their hearts are light,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For their possessions are secure; <i>their</i> wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">None drinks, or eats <i>their</i> viands, save their own, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l640" id="BXVII_l640"></a>640</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">While my abode, day after day, themselves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Haunting, my beeves and sheep and fatted goats<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slay for the banquet, and my casks exhaust<br></span>
<span class="i0">Extravagant, whence endless waste ensues;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For no such friend as was Ulysses once<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have I to expel the mischief. But might he<br></span>
<span class="i0">Revisit once his native shores again,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, aided by his son, he should avenge,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Incontinent, the wrongs which now I mourn.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then sneezed Telemachus with sudden force, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l650" id="BXVII_l650"></a>650</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That all the palace rang; his mother laugh’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in wing’d accents thus the swain bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Haste—bid him hither—hear’st thou not the sneeze<br></span>
<span class="i0">Propitious of my son? oh might it prove<br></span>
<span class="i0">A presage of inevitable death<br></span>
<span class="i0">To all these revellers! may none escape!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now mark me well. Should the event his tale<br></span>
<span class="i0">Confirm, at my own hands he shall receive<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mantle and tunic both for his reward.<br></span>
<span class="i1">She spake; he went, and where Ulysses sat <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l660" id="BXVII_l660"></a>660</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Arriving, in wing’d accents thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Penelope, my venerable friend!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Calls thee, the mother of Telemachus.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oppress’d by num’rous troubles, she desires<br></span>
<span class="i0">To ask thee tidings of her absent Lord.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And should the event verify thy report,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy meed shall be (a boon which much thou need’st)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tunic and mantle; but she gives no more;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy sustenance thou must, as now, obtain,<a name="fnm_78" id="fnm_78"></a><a href="#fn_78" class="fnnum">78</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">Begging it at their hands who chuse to give. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l670" id="BXVII_l670"></a>670</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Then thus Ulysses, Hero toil-inured.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eumæus! readily I can relate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Truth, and truth only, to the prudent Queen<br></span>
<span class="i0">Icarius’ daughter; for of him I know<br></span>
<span class="i0">Much, and have suff’red sorrows like his own.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But dread I feel of this imperious throng<br></span>
<span class="i0">Perverse, whose riot and outrageous acts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of violence echo through the vault of heav’n.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, even now, when for no fault of mine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yon suitor struck me as I pass’d, and fill’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l680" id="BXVII_l680"></a>680</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">My flesh with pain, neither Telemachus<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor any interposed to stay his arm.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now, therefore, let Penelope, although<br></span>
<span class="i0">Impatient, till the sun descend postpone<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her questions; then she may enquire secure<br></span>
<span class="i0">When comes her husband, and may nearer place<br></span>
<span class="i0">My seat to the hearth-side, for thinly clad<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou know’st I am, whose aid I first implored.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceas’d; at whose reply Eumæus sought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Again the Queen, but ere he yet had pass’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l690" id="BXVII_l690"></a>690</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The threshold, thus she greeted his return.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Com’st thou alone, Eumæus? why delays<br></span>
<span class="i0">The invited wand’rer? dreads he other harm?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or sees he aught that with a bashful awe<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fills him? the bashful poor are poor indeed.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He hath well spoken; none who would decline<br></span>
<span class="i0">The rudeness of this contumelious throng<br></span>
<span class="i0">Could answer otherwise; thee he entreats<br></span>
<span class="i0">To wait till sun-set, and that course, O Queen, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l700" id="BXVII_l700"></a>700</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt thyself far more commodious find,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To hold thy conf’rence with the guest, alone.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer thus Penelope return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The stranger, I perceive, is not unwise,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whoe’er he be, for on the earth are none<br></span>
<span class="i0">Proud, insolent, and profligate as these.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake the Queen. Then (all his message told)<br></span>
<span class="i0">The good Eumæus to the suitors went<br></span>
<span class="i0">Again, and with his head inclined toward<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus, lest others should his words <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l710" id="BXVII_l710"></a>710</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Witness, in accents wing’d him thus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Friend and kind master! I return to keep<br></span>
<span class="i0">My herds, and to attend my rural charge,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whence we are both sustain’d. Keep thou, meantime,<br></span>
<span class="i0">All here with vigilance, but chiefly watch<br></span>
<span class="i0">For thy own good, and save <i>thyself</i> from harm;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For num’rous here brood mischief, whom the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exterminate, ere yet their plots prevail!<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So be it, father! and (thy evening-mess <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVII_l720" id="BXVII_l720"></a>720</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Eaten) depart; to-morrow come again,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bringing fair victims hither; I will keep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I and the Gods, meantime, all here secure.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended; then resumed once more the swain<br></span>
<span class="i0">His polish’d seat, and, both with wine and food<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now satiate, to his charge return’d, the court<br></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving and all the palace throng’d with guests;<br></span>
<span class="i0">They (for it now was evening) all alike<br></span>
<span class="i0">Turn’d jovial to the song and to the dance.<br></span>

Eustathius, and Clarke after him, understand an aposiopesis here, as if
the speaker meant to say—what if there should be? or—suppose there
should be? But the sentence seems to fall in better with what follows
interpreted as above, and it is a sense of the passage not unwarranted by
the opinion of other commentators. See Schaufelbergerus.</p>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">The beggar Irus arrives at the palace; a combat takes place between him
and Ulysses, in which Irus is by one blow vanquished. Penelope appears to
the suitors, and having reminded them of the presents which she had a
right to expect from them, receives a gift from each. Eurymachus,
provoked by a speech of Ulysses, flings a foot-stool at him, which knocks
down the cup-bearer; a general tumult is the consequence, which
continues, till by the advice of Telemachus, seconded by Amphinomus, the
suitors retire to their respective homes.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now came a public mendicant, a man<br></span>
<span class="i0">Accustom’d, seeking alms, to roam the streets<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ithaca; one never sated yet<br></span>
<span class="i0">With food or drink; yet muscle had he none,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or strength of limb, though giant-built in show.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arnæus was the name which at his birth<br></span>
<span class="i0">His mother gave him, but the youthful band<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of suitors, whom as messenger he served,<br></span>
<span class="i0">All named him Irus. He, arriving, sought<br></span>
<span class="i0">To drive Ulysses forth from his own home, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l10" id="BXVIII_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And in rough accents rude him thus rebuked.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Forth from the porch, old man! lest by the foot<br></span>
<span class="i0">I drag thee quickly forth. Seest not how all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wink on me, and by signs give me command<br></span>
<span class="i0">To drag thee hence? nor is it aught but shame<br></span>
<span class="i0">That checks me. Yet arise, lest soon with fists<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou force me to adjust our diff’rence.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, low’ring dark, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Peace, fellow! neither word nor deed of mine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wrongs thee, nor feel I envy at the boon, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l20" id="BXVIII_l20"></a>20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">However plentiful, which thou receiv’st.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sill may hold us both; thou dost not well<br></span>
<span class="i0">To envy others; thou appear’st like me<br></span>
<span class="i0">A vagrant; plenty is the gift of heav’n.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But urge me not to trial of our fists,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lest thou provoke me, and I stain with blood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy bosom and thy lips, old as I am.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So, my attendance should to-morrow prove<br></span>
<span class="i0">More tranquil here; for thou should’st leave, I judge,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses’ mansion, never to return. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l30" id="BXVIII_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer’d Irus, kindling with disdain.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gods! with what volubility of speech<br></span>
<span class="i0">The table-hunter prates, like an old hag<br></span>
<span class="i0">Collied with chimney-smutch! but ah beware!<br></span>
<span class="i0">For I intend thee mischief, and to dash<br></span>
<span class="i0">With both hands ev’ry grinder from thy gums,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As men untooth a pig pilf’ring the corn.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Come—gird thee, that all here may view the strife—<br></span>
<span class="i0">But how wilt thou oppose one young as I?<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus on the threshold of the lofty gate <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l40" id="BXVIII_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">They, wrangling, chafed each other, whose dispute<br></span>
<span class="i0">The high-born youth Antinoüs mark’d; he laugh’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Delighted, and the suitors thus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Oh friends! no pastime ever yet occurr’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pleasant as this which, now, the Gods themselves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Afford us. Irus and the stranger brawl<br></span>
<span class="i0">As they would box. Haste—let us urge them on.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said; at once loud-laughing all arose;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The ill-clad disputants they round about<br></span>
<span class="i0">Encompass’d, and Antinoüs thus began. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l50" id="BXVIII_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Attend ye noble suitors to my voice.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Two paunches lie of goats here on the fire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which fill’d with fat and blood we set apart<br></span>
<span class="i0">For supper; he who conquers, and in force<br></span>
<span class="i0">Superior proves, shall freely take the paunch<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which he prefers, and shall with us thenceforth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Feast always; neither will we here admit<br></span>
<span class="i0">Poor man beside to beg at our repasts.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake, whom all approved; next, artful Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses thus, dissembling, them address’d. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l60" id="BXVIII_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Princes! unequal is the strife between<br></span>
<span class="i0">A young man and an old with mis’ry worn;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But hunger, always counsellor of ill,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Me moves to fight, that many a bruise received,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I may be foil’d at last. Now swear ye all<br></span>
<span class="i0">A solemn oath, that none, for Irus’ sake<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall, interposing, smite me with his fist<br></span>
<span class="i0">Clandestine, forcing me to yield the prize.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceas’d, and, as he bade, all present swore<br></span>
<span class="i0">A solemn oath; then thus, amid them all <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l70" id="BXVIII_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Standing, Telemachus majestic spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Guest! if thy courage and thy manly mind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Prompt thee to banish this man hence, no force<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fear thou beside, for who smites thee, shall find<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet other foes to cope with; I am here<br></span>
<span class="i0">In the host’s office, and the royal Chiefs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eurymachus and Antinoüs, alike<br></span>
<span class="i0">Discrete, accord unanimous with me.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceas’d, whom all approved. Then, with his rags<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses braced for decency his loins <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l80" id="BXVIII_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Around, but gave to view his brawny thighs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Proportion’d fair, and stripp’d his shoulders broad,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His chest and arms robust; while, at his side,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dilating more the Hero’s limbs and more<br></span>
<span class="i0">Minerva stood; the assembly with fixt eyes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Astonish’d gazed on him, and, looking full<br></span>
<span class="i0">On his next friend, a suitor thus remark’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Irus shall be in Irus found no more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He hath pull’d evil on himself. What thewes<br></span>
<span class="i0">And what a haunch the senior’s tatters hid! <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l90" id="BXVIII_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">So he—meantime in Irus’ heart arose<br></span>
<span class="i0">Horrible tumult; yet, his loins by force<br></span>
<span class="i0">Girding, the servants dragg’d him to the fight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pale, and his flesh all quiv’ring as he came;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose terrors thus Antinoüs sharp rebuked.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Now, wherefore liv’st, and why wast ever born<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou mountain-mass of earth! if such dismay<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shake thee at thought of combat with a man<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ancient as he, and worn with many woes?<br></span>
<span class="i0">But mark, I threaten not in vain; should he <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l100" id="BXVIII_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">O’ercome thee, and in force superior prove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Echetus thou go’st; my sable bark<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall waft thee to Epirus, where he reigns<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enemy of mankind; of nose and ears<br></span>
<span class="i0">He shall despoil thee with his ruthless steel,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And tearing by the roots the parts away<a name="fnm_79" id="fnm_79"></a><a href="#fn_79" class="fnnum">79</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">That mark thy sex, shall cast them to the dogs.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said; <i>His</i> limbs new terrors at that sound<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shook under him; into the middle space<br></span>
<span class="i0">They led him, and each raised his hands on high. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l110" id="BXVIII_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then doubtful stood Ulysses toil-inured,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whether to strike him lifeless to the earth<br></span>
<span class="i0">At once, or fell him with a managed blow.<br></span>
<span class="i0">To smite with managed force at length he chose<br></span>
<span class="i0">As wisest, lest, betray’d by his own strength,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He should be known. With elevated fists<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both stood; him Irus on the shoulder struck,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But he his adversary on the neck<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pash’d close beneath his ear; he split the bones,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And blood in sable streams ran from his mouth. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l120" id="BXVIII_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With many an hideous yell he dropp’d, his teeth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Chatter’d, and with his heels he drumm’d the ground.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The wooers, at that sight, lifting their hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">In glad surprize, laugh’d all their breath away.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, through the vestibule, and right across<br></span>
<span class="i0">The court, Ulysses dragg’d him by the foot<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into the portico, where propping him<br></span>
<span class="i0">Against the wall, and giving him his staff,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In accents wing’d he bade him thus farewell.<br></span>
<span class="i1">There seated now, dogs drive and swine away, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l130" id="BXVIII_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor claim (thyself so base) supreme controul<br></span>
<span class="i0">O’er other guests and mendicants, lest harm<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reach thee, hereafter, heavier still than this.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, his tatter’d wallet o’er his back<br></span>
<span class="i0">He threw suspended by its leathern twist,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And tow’rd the threshold turning, sat again,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They laughing ceaseless still, the palace-door<br></span>
<span class="i0">Re-enter’d, and him, courteous, thus bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Jove, and all Jove’s assessors in the skies<br></span>
<span class="i0">Vouchsafe thee, stranger, whatsoe’er it be, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l140" id="BXVIII_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy heart’s desire! who hast our ears reliev’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">From that insatiate beggar’s irksome tone.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Soon to Epirus he shall go dispatch’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Echetus the King, pest of mankind.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So they, to whose propitious words the Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Listen’d delighted. Then Antinoüs placed<br></span>
<span class="i0">The paunch before him, and Amphinomus<br></span>
<span class="i0">Two loaves, selected from the rest; he fill’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">A goblet also, drank to him, and said,<br></span>
<span class="i1">My father, hail! O stranger, be thy lot <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l150" id="BXVIII_l150"></a>150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Hereafter blest, though adverse now and hard!<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">To me, Amphinomus, endued thou seem’st<br></span>
<span class="i0">With much discretion, who art also son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of such a sire, whose fair report I know,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dulichian Nysus, opulent and good.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fame speaks thee his, and thou appear’st a man<br></span>
<span class="i0">Judicious; hear me, therefore; mark me well.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Earth nourishes, of all that breathe or creep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">No creature weak as man; for while the Gods <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l160" id="BXVIII_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Grant him prosperity and health, no fear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath he, or thought, that he shall ever mourn;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when the Gods with evils unforeseen<br></span>
<span class="i0">Smite him, he bears them with a grudging mind;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For such as the complexion of his lot<br></span>
<span class="i0">By the appointment of the Sire of all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such is the colour of the mind of man.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I, too, have been familiar in my day<br></span>
<span class="i0">With wealth and ease, but I was then self-will’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And many wrong’d, embolden’d by the thought <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l170" id="BXVIII_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of my own father’s and my brethren’s pow’r.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Let no man, therefore, be unjust, but each<br></span>
<span class="i0">Use modestly what gift soe’er of heav’n.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So do not these. These ever bent I see<br></span>
<span class="i0">On deeds injurious, the possessions large<br></span>
<span class="i0">Consuming, and dishonouring the wife<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of one, who will not, as I judge, remain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Long absent from his home, but is, perchance,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ev’n at the door. Thee, therefore, may the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Steal hence in time! ah, meet not his return <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l180" id="BXVIII_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To his own country! for they will not part,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(He and the suitors) without blood, I think,<br></span>
<span class="i0">If once he enter at these gates again!<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, and, libation pouring, quaff’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The generous juice, then in the prince’s hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Replaced the cup; he, pensive, and his head<br></span>
<span class="i0">Inclining low, pass’d from him; for his heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forboded ill; yet ’scaped not even he,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But in the snare of Pallas caught, his life<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the heroic arm and spear resign’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l190" id="BXVIII_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of brave Telemachus. Reaching, at length,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The seat whence he had ris’n, he sat again.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Minerva then, Goddess, cærulean-eyed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Prompted Icarius’ daughter to appear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before the suitors; so to expose the more<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their drift iniquitous, and that herself<br></span>
<span class="i0">More bright than ever in her husband’s eyes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Might shine, and in her son’s. Much mirth she feign’d,<a name="fnm_80" id="fnm_80"></a><a href="#fn_80" class="fnnum">80</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">And, bursting into laughter, thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">I wish, Eurynome! (who never felt <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l200" id="BXVIII_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That wish till now) though I detest them all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To appear before the suitors, in whose ears<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will admonish, for his good, my son,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not to associate with that lawless crew<br></span>
<span class="i0">Too much, who speak him fair, but foul intend.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer thus Eurynome return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My daughter! wisely hast thou said and well.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Go! bathe thee and anoint thy face, then give<br></span>
<span class="i0">To thy dear son such counsel as thou wilt<br></span>
<span class="i0">Without reserve; but shew not there thy cheeks <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l210" id="BXVIII_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Sullied with tears, for profit none accrues<br></span>
<span class="i0">From grief like thine, that never knows a change.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he is now bearded, and hath attained<br></span>
<span class="i0">That age which thou wast wont with warmest pray’r<br></span>
<span class="i0">To implore the Gods that he might live to see.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Her answer’d then Penelope discrete.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Persuade not me, though studious of my good,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To bathe, Eurynome! or to anoint<br></span>
<span class="i0">My face with oil; for all my charms the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Inhabitants of Olympus then destroy’d, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l220" id="BXVIII_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">When he, embarking, left me. Go, command<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hippodamia and Autonöe<br></span>
<span class="i0">That they attend me to the hall, and wait<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside me there; for decency forbids<br></span>
<span class="i0">That I should enter to the men, alone.<br></span>
<span class="i1">She ceas’d, and through the house the ancient dame<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hasted to summon whom she had enjoin’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">But Pallas, Goddess of the azure eyes,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Diffused, meantime, the kindly dew of sleep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Around Icarius’ daughter; on her couch <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l230" id="BXVIII_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Reclining, soon as she reclin’d, she dozed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And yielded to soft slumber all her frame.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, that the suitors might admire her more,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The glorious Goddess cloath’d her, as she lay,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With beauty of the skies; her lovely face<br></span>
<span class="i0">She with ambrosia purified, with such<br></span>
<span class="i0">As Cytherea chaplet-crown’d employs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Herself, when in the eye-ensnaring dance<br></span>
<span class="i0">She joins the Graces; to a statelier height<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath her touch, and ampler size she grew, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l240" id="BXVIII_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And fairer than the elephantine bone<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh from the carver’s hand. These gifts conferr’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Divine, the awful Deity retired.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now, loud-prattling as they came, arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her handmaids; sleep forsook her at the sound,<br></span>
<span class="i0">She wiped away a tear, and thus she said.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Me gentle sleep, sad mourner as I am,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath here involved. O would that by a death<br></span>
<span class="i0">As gentle chaste Diana would herself<br></span>
<span class="i0">This moment set me free, that I might waste <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l250" id="BXVIII_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">My life no longer in heart-felt regret<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of a lamented husband’s various worth<br></span>
<span class="i0">And virtue, for in Greece no Peer had he!<br></span>
<span class="i1">She said, and through her chambers’ stately door<br></span>
<span class="i0">Issuing, descended; neither went she sole,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But with those two fair menials of her train.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arriving, most majestic of her sex,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In presence of the num’rous guests, beneath<br></span>
<span class="i0">The portal of the stately dome she stood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Between her maidens, with her lucid veil <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l260" id="BXVIII_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Mantling her lovely cheeks. Then, ev’ry knee<br></span>
<span class="i0">Trembled, and ev’ry heart with am’rous heat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dissolv’d, her charms all coveting alike,<br></span>
<span class="i0">While to Telemachus her son she spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Telemachus! thou art no longer wise<br></span>
<span class="i0">As once thou wast, and even when a child.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For thriven as thou art, and at full size<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arrived of man, so fair proportion’d, too,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That ev’n a stranger, looking on thy growth<br></span>
<span class="i0">And beauty, would pronounce thee nobly born, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l270" id="BXVIII_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet is thy intellect still immature.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For what is this? why suffer’st thou a guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">To be abused in thy own palace? how?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Know’st not that if the stranger seated here<br></span>
<span class="i0">Endure vexation, the disgrace is thine?<br></span>
<span class="i1">Her answer’d, then, Telemachus discrete.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I blame thee not, my mother, that thou feel’st<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thine anger moved; yet want I not a mind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Able to mark and to discern between<br></span>
<span class="i0">Evil and good, child as I lately was, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l280" id="BXVIII_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Although I find not promptitude of thought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sufficient always, overaw’d and check’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">By such a multitude, all bent alike<br></span>
<span class="i0">On mischief, of whom none takes part with me.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But Irus and the stranger have not fought,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Urged by the suitors, and the stranger prov’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Victorious; yes—heav’n knows how much I wish<br></span>
<span class="i0">That, (in the palace some, some in the court)<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors all sat vanquish’d, with their heads<br></span>
<span class="i0">Depending low, and with enfeebled limbs, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l290" id="BXVIII_l290"></a>290</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Even as that same Irus, while I speak,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With chin on bosom propp’d at the hall-gate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sits drunkard-like, incapable to stand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Erect, or to regain his proper home.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So they; and now addressing to the Queen<br></span>
<span class="i0">His speech, Eurymachus thus interposed.<br></span>
<span class="i1">O daughter of Icarius! could all eyes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Throughout Iäsian Argos<a name="fnm_81" id="fnm_81"></a><a href="#fn_81" class="fnnum">81</a> view thy charms,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Discrete Penelope! more suitors still<br></span>
<span class="i0">Assembling in thy courts would banquet here <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l300" id="BXVIII_l300"></a>300</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">From morn to eve; for thou surpassest far<br></span>
<span class="i0">In beauty, stature, worth, all womankind.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom replied Penelope discrete.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Gods, Eurymachus! reduced to nought<br></span>
<span class="i0">My virtue, beauty, stature, when the Greeks,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom my Ulysses follow’d, sail’d to Troy.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Could he, returning, my domestic charge<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself intend, far better would my fame<br></span>
<span class="i0">Be so secured, and wider far diffused.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But I am wretched now, such storms the Gods <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l310" id="BXVIII_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of woe have sent me. When he left his home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Clasping my wrist with his right hand, he said.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My love! for I imagine not that all<br></span>
<span class="i0">The warrior Greeks shall safe from Troy return,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Since fame reports the Trojans brave in fight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Skill’d in the spear, mighty to draw the bow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And nimble vaulters to the backs of steeds<br></span>
<span class="i0">High-mettled, which to speediest issue bring<br></span>
<span class="i0">The dreadful struggle of all-wasting war—<br></span>
<span class="i0">I know not, therefore, whether heav’n intend <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l320" id="BXVIII_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">My safe return, or I must perish there.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But manage thou at home. Cherish, as now,<br></span>
<span class="i0">While I am absent, or more dearly still<br></span>
<span class="i0">My parents, and what time our son thou seest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mature, then wed; wed even whom thou wilt,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And hence to a new home.—Such were his words,<br></span>
<span class="i0">All which shall full accomplishment ere long<br></span>
<span class="i0">Receive. The day is near, when hapless I,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lost to all comfort by the will of Jove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Must meet the nuptials that my soul abhors. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l330" id="BXVIII_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But this thought now afflicts me, and my mind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Continual haunts. Such was not heretofore<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors’ custom’d practice; all who chose<br></span>
<span class="i0">To engage in competition for a wife<br></span>
<span class="i0">Well-qualitied and well-endow’d, produced<br></span>
<span class="i0">From their own herds and fatted flocks a feast<br></span>
<span class="i0">For the bride’s friends, and splendid presents made,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But never ate as ye, at others’ cost.<br></span>
<span class="i1">She ceased; then brave Ulysses toil-inured<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rejoiced that, soothing them, she sought to draw <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l340" id="BXVIII_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">From each some gift, although on other views,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And more important far, himself intent.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then thus Antinoüs, Eupithes’ son.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Icarius’ daughter wise! only accept<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such gifts as we shall bring, for gifts demand<br></span>
<span class="i0">That grace, nor can be decently refused;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But to our rural labours, or elsewhere<br></span>
<span class="i0">Depart not we, till first thy choice be made<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Achaian, chief in thy esteem.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Antinoüs spake, whose answer all approved. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l350" id="BXVIII_l350"></a>350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then each dispatch’d his herald who should bring<br></span>
<span class="i0">His master’s gift. Antinoüs’ herald, first<br></span>
<span class="i0">A mantle of surpassing beauty brought,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wide, various, with no fewer clasps adorn’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Than twelve, all golden, and to ev’ry clasp<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was fitted opposite its eye exact.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Next, to Eurymachus his herald bore<br></span>
<span class="i0">A necklace of wrought gold, with amber rich<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bestudded, ev’ry bead bright as a sun.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Two servants for Eurydamas produced <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l360" id="BXVIII_l360"></a>360</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ear-pendants fashion’d with laborious art,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Broad, triple-gemm’d, of brilliant light profuse.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The herald of Polyctor’s son, the prince<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pisander, brought a collar to his Lord,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A sumptuous ornament. Each Greecian gave,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And each a gift dissimilar from all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, loveliest of her sex, turning away,<br></span>
<span class="i0">She sought her chamber, whom her maidens fair<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attended, charged with those illustrious gifts.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then turn’d, they all to dance and pleasant song <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l370" id="BXVIII_l370"></a>370</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Joyous, expecting the approach of ev’n.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long the dusky evening came, and them<br></span>
<span class="i0">Found sporting still. Then, placing in the hall<br></span>
<span class="i0">Three hearths that should illumine wide the house,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They compass’d them around with fuel-wood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Long-season’d and new-split, mingling the sticks<br></span>
<span class="i0">With torches. The attendant women watch’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">And fed those fires by turns, to whom, himself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their unknown Sov’reign thus his speech address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ye maidens of the long-regretted Chief <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l380" id="BXVIII_l380"></a>380</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses! to the inner-courts retire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to your virtuous Queen, that following there<br></span>
<span class="i0">Your sev’ral tasks, spinning and combing wool,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ye may amuse her; I, meantime, for these<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will furnish light, and should they chuse to stay<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till golden morn appear, they shall not tire<br></span>
<span class="i0">My patience aught, for I can much endure.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said; they, titt’ring, on each other gazed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But one, Melantho with the blooming cheeks,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rebuked him rudely. Dolius was her sire, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l390" id="BXVIII_l390"></a>390</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But by Penelope she had been reared<br></span>
<span class="i0">With care maternal, and in infant years<br></span>
<span class="i0">Supplied with many a toy; yet even she<br></span>
<span class="i0">Felt not her mistress’ sorrows in her heart,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, of Eurymachus enamour’d, oft<br></span>
<span class="i0">His lewd embraces met; she, with sharp speech<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reproachful, to Ulysses thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Why—what a brainsick vagabond art thou!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who neither wilt to the smith’s forge retire<br></span>
<span class="i0">For sleep, nor to the public portico, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l400" id="BXVIII_l400"></a>400</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But here remaining, with audacious prate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Disturb’st this num’rous company, restrain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">By no respect or fear; either thou art<br></span>
<span class="i0">With wine intoxicated, or, perchance,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Art always fool, and therefore babblest now.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Say, art thou drunk with joy that thou hast foiled<br></span>
<span class="i0">The beggar Irus? Tremble, lest a man<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stronger than Irus suddenly arise,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who on thy temples pelting thee with blows<br></span>
<span class="i0">Far heavier than his, shall drive thee hence <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l410" id="BXVIII_l410"></a>410</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With many a bruise, and foul with thy own blood.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, frowning stern, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Snarler! Telemachus shall be inform’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">This moment of thy eloquent harangue,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That he may hew thee for it, limb from limb.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he scared the women; back they flew<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into the house, but each with falt’ring knees<br></span>
<span class="i0">Through dread, for they believ’d his threats sincere.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He, then illumin’d by the triple blaze,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Watch’d close the lights, busy from hearth to hearth, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l420" id="BXVIII_l420"></a>420</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But in his soul, meantime, far other thoughts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Revolved, tremendous, not conceived in vain.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Nor Pallas (that they might exasp’rate more<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laertes’ son) permitted to abstain<br></span>
<span class="i0">From heart-corroding bitterness of speech<br></span>
<span class="i0">Those suitors proud, of whom Eurymachus,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Offspring of Polybus, while thus he jeer’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, set the others in a roar.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Hear me, ye suitors of the illustrious Queen!<br></span>
<span class="i0">I shall promulge my thought. This man, methinks, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l430" id="BXVIII_l430"></a>430</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Not unconducted by the Gods, hath reach’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses’ mansion, for to me the light<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of yonder torches altogether seems<br></span>
<span class="i0">His own, an emanation from his head,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which not the smallest growth of hair obscures.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended; and the city-waster Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself accosted next. Art thou disposed<br></span>
<span class="i0">To serve me, friend! would I afford thee hire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A labourer at my farm? thou shalt not want<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sufficient wages; thou may’st there collect <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l440" id="BXVIII_l440"></a>440</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Stones for my fences, and may’st plant my oaks,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For which I would supply thee all the year<br></span>
<span class="i0">With food, and cloaths, and sandals for thy feet.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But thou hast learn’d less creditable arts,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor hast a will to work, preferring much<br></span>
<span class="i0">By beggary from others to extort<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wherewith to feed thy never-sated maw.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer, thus, Ulysses wise return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forbear, Eurymachus; for were we match’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">In work against each other, thou and I, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l450" id="BXVIII_l450"></a>450</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Mowing in spring-time, when the days are long,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I with my well-bent sickle in my hand,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou arm’d with one as keen, for trial sake<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of our ability to toil unfed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till night, grass still sufficing for the proof.—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or if, again, it were our task to drive<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yoked oxen of the noblest breed, sleek-hair’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Big-limb’d, both batten’d to the full with grass,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their age and aptitude for work the same<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not soon to be fatigued, and were the field <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l460" id="BXVIII_l460"></a>460</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In size four acres, with a glebe through which<br></span>
<span class="i0">The share might smoothly slide, then should’st thou see<br></span>
<span class="i0">How strait my furrow should be cut and true.—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or should Saturnian Jove this day excite<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here, battle, or elsewhere, and were I arm’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With two bright spears and with a shield, and bore<br></span>
<span class="i0">A brazen casque well-fitted to my brows,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Me, then, thou should’st perceive mingling in fight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the foremost Chiefs, nor with the crime<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of idle beggary should’st upbraid me more. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l470" id="BXVIII_l470"></a>470</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But thou art much a railer, one whose heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pity moves not, and seem’st a mighty man<br></span>
<span class="i0">And valiant to thyself, only because<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou herd’st with few, and those of little worth.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But should Ulysses come, at his own isle<br></span>
<span class="i0">Again arrived, wide as these portals are,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To thee, at once, too narrow they should seem<br></span>
<span class="i0">To shoot thee forth with speed enough abroad.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceased—then tenfold indignation fired<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eurymachus; he furrow’d deep his brow <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l480" id="BXVIII_l480"></a>480</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With frowns, and in wing’d accents thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Wretch, I shall roughly handle thee anon,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who thus with fluent prate presumptuous dar’st<br></span>
<span class="i0">Disturb this num’rous company, restrain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">By no respect or fear. Either thou art<br></span>
<span class="i0">With wine intoxicated, or, perchance,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Art always fool, and therefore babblest now;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or thou art frantic haply with delight<br></span>
<span class="i0">That thou hast foil’d yon vagabond obscure.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he seized a stool; but to the knees <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l490" id="BXVIII_l490"></a>490</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses flew of the Dulichian Prince<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amphinomus, and sat, fearing incensed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eurymachus; he on his better hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Smote full the cup-bearer; on the hall-floor<br></span>
<span class="i0">Loud rang the fallen beaker, and himself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lay on his back clamouring in the dust.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Strait through the dusky hall tumult ensued<br></span>
<span class="i0">Among the suitors, of whom thus, a youth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With eyes directed to the next, exclaim’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Would that this rambling stranger had elsewhere <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l500" id="BXVIII_l500"></a>500</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Perish’d, or ever he had here arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then no such uproar had he caused as this!<br></span>
<span class="i0">This doth the beggar; he it is for whom<br></span>
<span class="i0">We wrangle thus, and may despair of peace<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or pleasure more; now look for strife alone.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then in the midst Telemachus upstood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Majestic, and the suitors thus bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sirs! ye are mad, and can no longer eat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or drink in peace; some dæmon troubles you.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But since ye all have feasted, to your homes <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l510" id="BXVIII_l510"></a>510</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Go now, and, at your pleasure, to your beds;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Soonest were best, but I thrust no man hence.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceased; they gnawing stood their lips, aghast<br></span>
<span class="i0">With wonder that Telemachus in his speech<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such boldness used. Then rose Amphinomus,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Brave son of Nisus offspring of the King<br></span>
<span class="i0">Aretus, and the assembly thus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My friends! let none with contradiction thwart<br></span>
<span class="i0">And rude reply words rational and just;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Assault no more the stranger, nor of all <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l520" id="BXVIII_l520"></a>520</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The servants of renown’d Ulysses here<br></span>
<span class="i0">Harm any. Come. Let the cup-bearer fill<br></span>
<span class="i0">To all, that due libation made, to rest<br></span>
<span class="i0">We may repair at home, leaving the Prince<br></span>
<span class="i0">To accommodate beneath his father’s roof<br></span>
<span class="i0">The stranger, for he is the Prince’s guest.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, whose advice none disapproved.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Hero Mulius then, Dulichian-born,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And herald of Amphinomus, the cup<br></span>
<span class="i0">Filling, dispensed it, as he stood, to all; <span class="linenum"><a name="BXVIII_l530" id="BXVIII_l530"></a>530</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">They, pouring forth to the Immortals, quaff’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The luscious bev’rage, and when each had made<br></span>
<span class="i0">Libation, and such measure as he would<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of wine had drunk, then all to rest retired.<br></span>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">Ulysses and Telemachus remove the arms from the hall to an upper-chamber.
The Hero then confers with Penelope, to whom he gives a fictitious
narrative of his adventures. Euryclea, while bathing Ulysses, discovers
him by a scar on his knee, but he prevents her communication of that
discovery to Penelope.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They went, but left the noble Chief behind<br></span>
<span class="i0">In his own house, contriving by the aid<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Pallas, the destruction of them all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thus, in accents wing’d, again he said.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My son! we must remove and safe dispose<br></span>
<span class="i0">All these my well-forged implements of war;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And should the suitors, missing them, enquire<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where are they? thou shalt answer smoothly thus—<br></span>
<span class="i0">I have convey’d them from the reach of smoke,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For they appear no more the same which erst <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l10" id="BXIX_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, going hence to Ilium, left,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So smirch’d and sullied by the breath of fire.<br></span>
<span class="i0">This weightier reason (thou shalt also say)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some God suggested to me,—lest, inflamed<br></span>
<span class="i0">With wine, ye wound each other in your brawls,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shaming both feast and courtship; for the view<br></span>
<span class="i0">Itself of arms incites to their abuse.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceased, and, in obedience to his will,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Calling the ancient Euryclea forth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His nurse, Telemachus enjoin’d her thus. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l20" id="BXIX_l20"></a>20</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Go—shut the women in; make fast the doors<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of their apartment, while I safe dispose<br></span>
<span class="i0">Elsewhere, my father’s implements of war,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which, during his long absence, here have stood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till smoke hath sullied them. For I have been<br></span>
<span class="i0">An infant hitherto, but, wiser grown,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Would now remove them from the breath of fire.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then thus the gentle matron in return.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yes truly—and I wish that now, at length,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou would’st assert the privilege of thy years, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l30" id="BXIX_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">My son, thyself assuming charge of all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both house and stores; but who shall bear the light?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Since they, it seems, who would, are all forbidden.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Telemachus discrete replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">This guest; for no man, from my table fed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Come whence he may; shall be an idler here.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, nor his words flew wing’d away,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But Euryclea bolted every door.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, starting to the task, Ulysses caught,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And his illustrious son, the weapons thence, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l40" id="BXIX_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Helmet, and bossy shield, and pointed spear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">While Pallas from a golden lamp illumed<br></span>
<span class="i0">The dusky way before them. At that sight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alarm’d, the Prince his father thus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Whence—whence is this, my father? I behold<br></span>
<span class="i0">A prodigy! the walls of the whole house,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The arches, fir-tree beams, and pillars tall<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shine in my view, as with the blaze of fire!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some Pow’r celestial, doubtless, is within.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l50" id="BXIX_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Soft! ask no questions. Give no vent to thought,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such is the custom of the Pow’rs divine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hence, thou, to bed. I stay, that I may yet<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both in thy mother and her maidens move<br></span>
<span class="i0">More curiosity; yes—she with tears<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall question me of all that I have seen.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, and the Prince, at his command,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Guided by flaming torches, sought the couch<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where he was wont to sleep, and there he slept<br></span>
<span class="i0">On that night also, waiting the approach <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l60" id="BXIX_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of sacred dawn. Thus was Ulysses left<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alone, and planning sat in solitude,<br></span>
<span class="i0">By Pallas’ aid, the slaughter of his foes.<br></span>
<span class="i1">At length, Diana-like, or like herself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">All golden Venus, (her apartment left)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enter’d Penelope. Beside the hearth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her women planted her accustom’d seat<br></span>
<span class="i0">With silver wreathed and ivory. That throne<br></span>
<span class="i0">Icmalius made, artist renown’d, and join’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">A footstool to its splendid frame beneath, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l70" id="BXIX_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Which ever with an ample fleece they spread.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There sat discrete Penelope; then came<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her beautiful attendants from within,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who cleared the litter’d bread, the board, and cups<br></span>
<span class="i0">From which the insolent companions drank.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They also raked the embers from the hearths<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now dim, and with fresh billets piled them high,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both for illumination and for warmth.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then yet again Melantho with rude speech<br></span>
<span class="i0">Opprobrious, thus, assail’d Ulysses’ ear. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l80" id="BXIX_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Guest—wilt thou trouble us throughout the night<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ranging the house? and linger’st thou a spy<br></span>
<span class="i0">Watching the women? Hence—get thee abroad<br></span>
<span class="i0">Glad of such fare as thou hast found, or soon<br></span>
<span class="i0">With torches beaten we will thrust thee forth.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, frowning stern, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Petulant woman! wherefore thus incensed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Inveigh’st thou against me? is it because<br></span>
<span class="i0">I am not sleek? because my garb is mean?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Because I beg? thanks to necessity— <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l90" id="BXIX_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I would not else. But such as I appear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such all who beg and all who wander are.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I also lived the happy owner once<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of such a stately mansion, and have giv’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">To num’rous wand’rers, whencesoe’er they came,<br></span>
<span class="i0">All that they needed; I was also served<br></span>
<span class="i0">By many, and enjoy’d all that denotes<br></span>
<span class="i0">The envied owner opulent and blest.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But Jove (for so it pleas’d him) hath reduced<br></span>
<span class="i0">My all to nothing. Therefore well beware <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l100" id="BXIX_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou also, mistress, lest a day arrive<br></span>
<span class="i0">When all these charms by which thou shin’st among<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy sister-menials, fade; fear, too, lest her<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou should’st perchance irritate, whom thou serv’st,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And lest Ulysses come, of whose return<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hope yet survives; but even though the Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have perish’d, as ye think, and comes no more,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Consider yet his son, how bright the gifts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shine of Apollo in the illustrious Prince<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus; no woman, unobserved <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l110" id="BXIX_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">By him, can now commit a trespass here;<br></span>
<span class="i0">His days of heedless infancy are past.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, whom Penelope discrete<br></span>
<span class="i0">O’erhearing, her attendant sharp rebuked.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Shameless, audacious woman! known to me<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is thy great wickedness, which with thy life<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt atone; for thou wast well aware,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Hearing it from myself) that I design’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To ask this stranger of my absent Lord,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For whose dear sake I never cease to mourn. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l120" id="BXIX_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Then to her household’s governess she said.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bring now a seat, and spread it with a fleece,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eurynome! that, undisturb’d, the guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">May hear and answer all that I shall ask.<br></span>
<span class="i1">She ended. Then the matron brought in haste<br></span>
<span class="i0">A polish’d seat, and spread it with a fleece,<br></span>
<span class="i0">On which the toil-accustom’d Hero sat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thus the chaste Penelope began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Stranger! my first enquiry shall be this—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who art thou? whence? where born? and sprung from whom? <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l130" id="BXIX_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer thus Ulysses, wise, return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">O Queen! uncensurable by the lips<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of mortal man! thy glory climbs the skies<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unrivall’d, like the praise of some great King<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who o’er a num’rous people and renown’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Presiding like a Deity, maintains<br></span>
<span class="i0">Justice and truth. The earth, under his sway,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her produce yields abundantly; the trees<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fruit-laden bend; the lusty flocks bring forth;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Ocean teems with finny swarms beneath <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l140" id="BXIX_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His just controul, and all the land is blest.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Me therefore, question of what else thou wilt<br></span>
<span class="i0">In thy own palace, but forbear to ask<br></span>
<span class="i0">From whom I sprang, and of my native land,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lest thou, reminding me of those sad themes,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Augment my woes; for I have much endured;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor were it seemly, in another’s house,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To pass the hours in sorrow and in tears,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wearisome when indulg’d with no regard<br></span>
<span class="i0">To time or place; thy train (perchance thyself) <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l150" id="BXIX_l150"></a>150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Would blame me, and I should reproach incur<br></span>
<span class="i0">As one tear-deluged through excess of wine.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d then Penelope discrete.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The immortal Gods, O stranger, then destroy’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">My form, my grace, my beauty, when the Greeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom my Ulysses follow’d, sail’d to Troy.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Could he, returning, my domestic charge<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself intend, far better would my fame<br></span>
<span class="i0">Be so secured, and wider far diffused.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But I am wretched now, such storms of woe <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l160" id="BXIX_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The Gods have sent me; for as many Chiefs<br></span>
<span class="i0">As hold dominion in the neighbour isles<br></span>
<span class="i0">Samos, Dulichium, and the forest-crown’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Zacynthus; others, also, rulers here<br></span>
<span class="i0">In pleasant Ithaca, me, loth to wed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Woo ceaseless, and my household stores consume.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I therefore, neither guest nor suppliant heed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor public herald more, but with regret<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of my Ulysses wear my soul away.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They, meantime, press my nuptials, which by art <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l170" id="BXIX_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I still procrastinate. Some God the thought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Suggested to me, to commence a robe<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of amplest measure and of subtlest woof,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laborious task; which done, I thus address’d them.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Princes, my suitors! since the noble Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses is no more, enforce not now<br></span>
<span class="i0">My nuptials; wait till I shall finish first<br></span>
<span class="i0">A fun’ral robe (lest all my threads be marr’d)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which for the ancient Hero I prepare<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laertes, looking for the mournful hour <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l180" id="BXIX_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">When fate shall snatch him to eternal rest.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Else, I the censure dread of all my sex,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should he, so wealthy, want at last a shroud.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such was my speech; they, unsuspicious all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With my request complied. Thenceforth, all day<br></span>
<span class="i0">I wove the ample web, and, by the aid<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of torches, ravell’d it again at night.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Three years by artifice I thus their suit<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eluded safe; but when the fourth arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the same season after many moons <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l190" id="BXIX_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And fleeting days return’d, passing my train<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who had neglected to release the dogs,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They came, surprized and reprimanded me.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, through necessity, not choice, at last<br></span>
<span class="i0">I have perform’d it, in my own despight.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But no escape from marriage now remains,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor other subterfuge for me; meantime<br></span>
<span class="i0">My parents urge my nuptials, and my son<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Of age to note it) with disgust observes<br></span>
<span class="i0">His wealth consumed; for he is now become <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l200" id="BXIX_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Adult, and abler than myself to rule<br></span>
<span class="i0">The house, a Prince distinguish’d by the Gods,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, stranger, after all, speak thy descent;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Say whence thou art; for not of fabulous birth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Art thou, nor from the oak, nor from the rock.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Her answer’d then Ulysses, ever-wise.<br></span>
<span class="i0">O spouse revered of Laertiades!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Resolv’st thou still to learn from whom I sprang?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Learn then; but know that thou shalt much augment<br></span>
<span class="i0">My present grief, natural to a man <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l210" id="BXIX_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Who hath, like me, long exiled from his home<br></span>
<span class="i0">Through various cities of the sons of men<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wander’d remote, and num’rous woes endured.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, though it pain me, I will tell thee all.<br></span>
<span class="i1">There is a land amid the sable flood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Call’d Crete; fair, fruitful, circled by the sea.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Num’rous are her inhabitants, a race<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not to be summ’d, and ninety towns she boasts.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Diverse their language is; Achaians some,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And some indigenous are; Cydonians there, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l220" id="BXIX_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Crest-shaking Dorians, and Pelasgians dwell.<br></span>
<span class="i0">One city in extent the rest exceeds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cnossus; the city in which Minos reign’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, ever at a nine years’ close, conferr’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With Jove himself; from him my father sprang<br></span>
<span class="i0">The brave Deucalion; for Deucalion’s sons<br></span>
<span class="i0">Were two, myself and King Idomeneus.<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Ilium he, on board his gallant barks,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Follow’d the Atridæ. I, the youngest-born,<br></span>
<span class="i0">By my illustrious name, Æthon, am known, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l230" id="BXIX_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But he ranks foremost both in worth and years.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There I beheld Ulysses, and within<br></span>
<span class="i0">My walls receiv’d him; for a violent wind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had driv’n him from Malea (while he sought<br></span>
<span class="i0">The shores of Troy) to Crete. The storm his barks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bore into the Amnisus, for the cave<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ilythia known, a dang’rous port,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And which with difficulty he attain’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He, landing, instant to the city went,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seeking Idomeneus; his friend of old, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l240" id="BXIX_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">As he affirm’d, and one whom much he lov’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But <i>he</i> was far remote, ten days advanced,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps eleven, on his course to Troy.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Him, therefore, I conducted to my home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where hospitably, and with kindest care<br></span>
<span class="i0">I entertain’d him, (for I wanted nought)<br></span>
<span class="i0">And for himself procured and for his band,—<br></span>
<span class="i0">By public contribution, corn, and wine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And beeves for food, that all might be sufficed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Twelve days his noble Greecians there abode, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l250" id="BXIX_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Port-lock’d by Boreas blowing with a force<br></span>
<span class="i0">Resistless even on the land, some God<br></span>
<span class="i0">So roused his fury; but the thirteenth day<br></span>
<span class="i0">The wind all fell, and they embark’d again.<br></span>
<span class="i1">With many a fiction specious, as he sat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He thus her ear amused; she at the sound<br></span>
<span class="i0">Melting, with fluent tears her cheeks bedew’d;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And as the snow by Zephyrus diffused,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Melts on the mountain tops, when Eurus breathes,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And fills the channels of the running streams, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l260" id="BXIX_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">So melted she, and down her lovely cheeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pour’d fast the tears, him mourning as remote<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who sat beside her. Soft compassion touch’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses of his consort’s silent woe;<br></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes as they had been of steel or horn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Moved not, yet artful, he suppress’d his tears,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And she, at length with overflowing grief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Satiate, replied, and thus enquired again.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Now, stranger, I shall prove thee, as I judge,<br></span>
<span class="i0">If thou, indeed, hast entertain’d in Crete <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l270" id="BXIX_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">My spouse and his brave followers, as thou say’st.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Describe his raiment and himself; his own<br></span>
<span class="i0">Appearance, and the appearance of his friends.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then her Ulysses answer’d, ever-wise.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hard is the task, O Queen! (so long a time<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath since elaps’d) to tell thee. Twenty years<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have pass’d since he forsook my native isle,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, from my best remembrance, I will give<br></span>
<span class="i0">A likeness of him, such as now I may.<br></span>
<span class="i0">A double cloak, thick-piled, Mœonian dyed, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l280" id="BXIX_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The noble Chief had on; two fast’nings held<br></span>
<span class="i0">The golden clasp, and it display’d in front<br></span>
<span class="i0">A well-wrought pattern with much art design’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">An hound between his fore-feet holding fast<br></span>
<span class="i0">A dappled fawn, gaped eager on his prey.<br></span>
<span class="i0">All wonder’d, seeing, how in lifeless gold<br></span>
<span class="i0">Express’d, the dog with open mouth her throat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attempted still, and how the fawn with hoofs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thrust trembling forward, struggled to escape.<br></span>
<span class="i0">That glorious mantle much I noticed, soft <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l290" id="BXIX_l290"></a>290</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To touch, as the dried garlick’s glossy film;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such was the smoothness of it, and it shone<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sun-bright; full many a maiden, trust me, view’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The splendid texture with admiring eyes.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But mark me now; deep treasure in thy mind<br></span>
<span class="i0">This word. I know not if Ulysses wore<br></span>
<span class="i0">That cloak at home, or whether of his train<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some warrior gave it to him on his way,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or else some host of his; for many loved<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, and with him might few compare. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l300" id="BXIX_l300"></a>300</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I gave to him, myself, a brazen sword,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A purple cloak magnificent, and vest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of royal length, and when he sought his bark,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With princely pomp dismiss’d him from the shore.<br></span>
<span class="i0">An herald also waited on the Chief,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Somewhat his Senior; him I next describe.<br></span>
<span class="i0">His back was bunch’d, his visage swarthy, curl’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">His poll, and he was named Eurybates;<br></span>
<span class="i0">A man whom most of all his followers far<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses honour’d, for their minds were one. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l310" id="BXIX_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceased; she recognising all the proofs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Distinctly by Ulysses named, was moved<br></span>
<span class="i0">Still more to weep, till with o’erflowing grief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Satiate, at length she answer’d him again.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Henceforth, O stranger, thou who hadst before<br></span>
<span class="i0">My pity, shalt my rev’rence share and love,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I folded for him (with these <a class="correction" title="closing ) added" href="#tnotes">hands)</a> the cloak<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which thou describ’st, produced it when he went,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And gave it to him; I that splendid clasp<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attach’d to it myself, more to adorn <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l320" id="BXIX_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">My honour’d Lord, whom to his native land<br></span>
<span class="i0">Return’d secure I shall receive no more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">In such an evil hour Ulysses went<br></span>
<span class="i0">To that bad city never to be named.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Consort revered of Laertiades!<br></span>
<span class="i0">No longer let anxiety impair<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy beauteous form, nor any grief consume<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy spirits more for thy Ulysses’ sake.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And yet I blame thee not; a wife deprived <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l330" id="BXIX_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of her first mate to whom she had produced<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fair fruit of mutual love, would mourn his loss,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Although he were inferior far to thine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom fame affirms the semblance of the Gods.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But cease to mourn. Hear me. I will relate<br></span>
<span class="i0">A faithful tale, nor will from thee withhold<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such tidings of Ulysses living still,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And of his safe return, as I have heard<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lately, in yon neighb’ring opulent land<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Thesprotians. He returns enrich’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l340" id="BXIX_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With many precious stores from those obtain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom he hath visited; but he hath lost,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Departing from Thrinacia’s isle, his bark<br></span>
<span class="i0">And all his lov’d companions in the Deep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For Jove was adverse to him, and the Sun,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose beeves his followers slew. They perish’d all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the billowy flood; but Him, the keel<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bestriding of his bark, the waves at length<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cast forth on the Phæacian’s land, a race<br></span>
<span class="i0">Allied to heav’n, who rev’renced like a God <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l350" id="BXIX_l350"></a>350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy husband, honour’d him with num’rous gifts,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And willing were to have convey’d him home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, therefore, had attained long since<br></span>
<span class="i0">His native shore, but that he deem’d it best<br></span>
<span class="i0">To travel far, that he might still amass<br></span>
<span class="i0">More wealth; so much Ulysses all mankind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Excels in policy, and hath no peer.<br></span>
<span class="i0">This information from Thesprotia’s King<br></span>
<span class="i0">I gain’d, from Phidon; to myself he swore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Libation off’ring under his own roof, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l360" id="BXIX_l360"></a>360</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That both the bark was launch’d, and the stout crew<br></span>
<span class="i0">Prepared, that should conduct him to his home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But me he first dismiss’d; for, as it chanced,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A ship lay there of the Thesprotians, bound<br></span>
<span class="i0">To corn-enrich’d Dulichium. All the wealth<br></span>
<span class="i0">He shew’d me by the Chief amass’d, a store<br></span>
<span class="i0">To feed the house of yet another Prince<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the tenth generation; so immense<br></span>
<span class="i0">His treasures were within that palace lodg’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself he said was to Dodona gone, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l370" id="BXIX_l370"></a>370</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Counsel to ask from the oracular oaks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sublime of Jove, how safest he might seek,<br></span>
<span class="i0">After long exile thence, his native land,<br></span>
<span class="i0">If openly were best, or in disguise.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, therefore, he is safe, and at his home<br></span>
<span class="i0">Well-nigh arrived, nor shall his country long<br></span>
<span class="i0">Want him. I swear it with a solemn oath.<br></span>
<span class="i0">First Jove be witness, King and Lord of all!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Next these domestic Gods of the renown’d<br></span>

<span class="i0">No; I will pass, as I am wont to pass<br></span>

<span class="i1">Alas! my son, trouble for thy dear sake<br></span>
<span class="i0">Distracts me. Jove surely of all mankind<br></span>

<span class="i0">All hope of thy return—oh ancient sir!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Him too, perchance, where’er he sits a guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath some foreign roof, the women taunt,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As all these shameless ones have taunted thee,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fearing whose mock’ry thou forbidd’st their hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">This office, which Icarius’ daughter wise<br></span>
<span class="i0">To me enjoins, and which I, glad perform.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, I will wash thy feet; both for her sake<br></span>
<span class="i0">And for thy own,—for sight of thee hath raised <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l470" id="BXIX_l470"></a>470</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A tempest in my mind. Hear now the cause!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Full many a guest forlorn we entertain,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But never any have I seen, whose size,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The fashion of whose foot and pitch of voice,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such likeness of Ulysses show’d, as thine.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-shrewd, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such close similitude, O ancient dame!<br></span>
<span class="i0">As thou observ’st between thy Lord and me,<br></span>
<span class="i0">All, who have seen us both, have ever found.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said; then taking the resplendent vase <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l480" id="BXIX_l480"></a>480</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Allotted always to that use, she first<br></span>
<span class="i0">Infused cold water largely, then, the warm.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses (for beside the hearth he sat)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Turn’d quick his face into the shade, alarm’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lest, handling him, she should at once remark<br></span>
<span class="i0">His scar, and all his stratagem unveil.<br></span>
<span class="i0">She then, approaching, minister’d the bath<br></span>
<span class="i0">To her own King, and at first touch discern’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">That token, by a bright-tusk’d boar of old<br></span>
<span class="i0">Impress’d, what time he to Parnassus went <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l490" id="BXIX_l490"></a>490</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To visit there Autolycus and his sons,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His mother’s noble sire, who all mankind<br></span>
<span class="i0">In furtive arts and fraudful oaths excell’d.<a name="fnm_83" id="fnm_83"></a><a href="#fn_83" class="fnnum">83</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">For such endowments he by gift receiv’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">From Hermes’ self, to whom the thighs of kids<br></span>
<span class="i0">He offer’d and of lambs, and, in return,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The watchful Hermes never left his side.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Autolycus arriving in the isle<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of pleasant Ithaca, the new-born son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of his own daughter found, whom on his knees <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l500" id="BXIX_l500"></a>500</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">At close of supper Euryclea placed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thus the royal visitant address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thyself, Autolycus! devise a name<br></span>
<span class="i0">For thy own daughter’s son, by num’rous pray’rs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of thine and fervent, from the Gods obtained.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer thus Autolycus return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My daughter and my daughter’s spouse! the name<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which I shall give your boy, that let him bear.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Since after provocation and offence<br></span>
<span class="i0">To numbers giv’n of either sex, I come, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l510" id="BXIX_l510"></a>510</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Call him Ulysses;<a name="fnm_84" id="fnm_84"></a><a href="#fn_84" class="fnnum">84</a> and when, grown mature,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He shall Parnassus visit, the abode<br></span>
<span class="i0">Magnificent in which his mother dwelt,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And where my treasures lie, from my own stores<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will enrich and send him joyful home.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ulysses, therefore, that he might obtain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Those princely gifts, went thither. Him arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With right-hand gratulation and with words<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of welcome kind, Autolycus received,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor less his offspring; but the mother most <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l520" id="BXIX_l520"></a>520</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of his own mother clung around his neck,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amphithea; she with many a fervent kiss<br></span>
<span class="i0">His forehead press’d, and his bright-beaming eyes.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then bade Autolycus his noble sons<br></span>
<span class="i0">Set forth a banquet. They, at his command,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Led in a fatted ox of the fifth year,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which slaying first, they spread him carved abroad,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then scored his flesh, transfixed it with the spits,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And roasting all with culinary skill<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exact, gave each his portion. Thus they sat <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l530" id="BXIX_l530"></a>530</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Feasting all day, and till the sun declined,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when the sun declined, and darkness fell,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Each sought his couch, and took the gift of sleep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, soon as day-spring’s daughter rosy-palm’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Aurora look’d abroad, forth went the hounds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, with the hounds Ulysses, and the youths,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sons of Autolycus, to chase the boar.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arrived at the Parnassian mount, they climb’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">His bushy sides, and to his airy heights<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long attain’d. It was the pleasant hour <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l540" id="BXIX_l540"></a>540</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">When from the gently-swelling flood profound<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sun, emerging, first smote on the fields.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The hunters reach’d the valley; foremost ran,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Questing, the hounds; behind them, swift, the sons<br></span>
<span class="i0">Came of Autolycus, with whom advanced<br></span>
<span class="i0">The illustrious Prince Ulysses, pressing close<br></span>
<span class="i0">The hounds, and brandishing his massy spear.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There, hid in thickest shades, lay an huge boar.<br></span>
<span class="i0">That covert neither rough winds blowing moist<br></span>
<span class="i0">Could penetrate, nor could the noon-day sun <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l550" id="BXIX_l550"></a>550</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Smite through it, or fast-falling show’rs pervade,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So thick it was, and underneath the ground<br></span>
<span class="i0">With litter of dry foliage strew’d profuse.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hunters and dogs approaching him, his ear<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sound of feet perceived; upridging high<br></span>
<span class="i0">His bristly back and glaring fire, he sprang<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from the shrubs, and in defiance stood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Near and right opposite. Ulysses, first,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rush’d on him, elevating his long spear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ardent to wound him; but, preventing quick <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l560" id="BXIX_l560"></a>560</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His foe, the boar gash’d him above the knee.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Much flesh, assailing him oblique, he tore<br></span>
<span class="i0">With his rude tusk, but to the Hero’s bone<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pierced not; Ulysses <i>his</i> right shoulder reach’d;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with a deadly thrust impell’d the point<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of his bright spear through him and far beyond.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Loud yell’d the boar, sank in the dust, and died.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Around Ulysses, then, the busy sons<br></span>
<span class="i0">Throng’d of Autolycus; expert they braced<br></span>
<span class="i0">The wound of the illustrious hunter bold, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l570" id="BXIX_l570"></a>570</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With incantation staunched the sable blood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And sought in haste their father’s house again,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whence, heal’d and gratified with splendid gifts<br></span>
<span class="i0">They sent him soon rejoicing to his home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Themselves rejoicing also. Glad their son<br></span>
<span class="i0">His parents saw again, and of the scar<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enquired, where giv’n, and how? He told them all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">How to Parnassus with his friends he went,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sons of Autolycus to hunt, and how<br></span>
<span class="i0">A boar had gash’d him with his iv’ry tusk. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l580" id="BXIX_l580"></a>580</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">That scar, while chafing him with open palms,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The matron knew; she left his foot to fall;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Down dropp’d his leg into the vase; the brass<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rang, and o’ertilted by the sudden shock,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Poured forth the water, flooding wide the floor.<br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Her</i> spirit joy at once and sorrow seized;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tears fill’d her eyes; her intercepted voice<br></span>
<span class="i0">Died in her throat; but to Ulysses’ beard<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her hand advancing, thus, at length, she spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thou art himself, Ulysses. Oh my son! <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l590" id="BXIX_l590"></a>590</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Dear to me, and my master as thou art,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I knew thee not, till I had touch’d the scar.<br></span>
<span class="i1">She said, and to Penelope her eyes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Directed, all impatient to declare<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her own Ulysses even then at home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But she, nor eye nor ear for aught that pass’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had then, her fixt attention so entire<br></span>
<span class="i0">Minerva had engaged. Then, darting forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">His arms, the Hero with his right-hand close<br></span>
<span class="i0">Compress’d her throat, and nearer to himself <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l600" id="BXIX_l600"></a>600</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Drawing her with his left, thus caution’d her.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Why would’st thou ruin me? Thou gav’st me milk<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thyself from thy own breast. See me return’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">After long suff’rings, in the twentieth year,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To my own land. But since (some God the thought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Suggesting to thee) thou hast learn’d the truth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Silence! lest others learn it from thy lips.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For this I say, nor shall the threat be vain;<br></span>
<span class="i0">If God vouchsafe to me to overcome<br></span>
<span class="i0">The haughty suitors, when I shall inflict <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l610" id="BXIX_l610"></a>610</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Death on the other women of my house,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Although my nurse, thyself shalt also die.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d Euryclea then, discrete.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My son! oh how could so severe a word<br></span>
<span class="i0">Escape thy lips? my fortitude of mind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou know’st, and even now shalt prove me firm<br></span>
<span class="i0">As iron, secret as the stubborn rock.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But hear and mark me well. Should’st thou prevail,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Assisted by a Pow’r divine, to slay<br></span>
<span class="i0">The haughty suitors, I will then, myself, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l620" id="BXIX_l620"></a>620</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Give thee to know of all the female train<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who have dishonour’d thee, and who respect.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My nurse, it were superfluous; spare thy tongue<br></span>
<span class="i0">That needless task. I can distinguish well<br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself, between them, and shall know them all;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But hold thy peace. Hush! leave it with the Gods.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So he; then went the ancient matron forth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That she might serve him with a second bath,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For the whole first was spilt. Thus, laved at length, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l630" id="BXIX_l630"></a>630</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And smooth’d with oil, Ulysses nearer pull’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">His seat toward the glowing hearth to enjoy<br></span>
<span class="i0">More warmth, and drew his tatters o’er the scar.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, prudent, thus Penelope began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">One question, stranger, I shall yet propound,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Though brief, for soon the hour of soft repose<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grateful to all, and even to the sad<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom gentle sleep forsakes not, will arrive.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But heav’n to me immeasurable woe<br></span>
<span class="i0">Assigns,—whose sole delight is to consume <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l640" id="BXIX_l640"></a>640</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">My days in sighs, while here retired I sit,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Watching my maidens’ labours and my own;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But (night return’d, and all to bed retired)<br></span>
<span class="i0">I press mine also, yet with deep regret<br></span>
<span class="i0">And anguish lacerated, even there.<br></span>
<span class="i0">As when at spring’s first entrance, her sweet song<br></span>
<span class="i0">The azure-crested nightingale renews,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Daughter of Pandarus; within the grove’s<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thick foliage perch’d, she pours her echoing voice<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now deep, now clear, still varying the strain <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l650" id="BXIX_l650"></a>650</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With which she mourns her Itylus, her son<br></span>
<span class="i0">By royal Zethus, whom she, erring, slew,<a name="fnm_85" id="fnm_85"></a><a href="#fn_85" class="fnnum">85</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">So also I, by soul-distressing doubts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Toss’d ever, muse if I shall here remain<br></span>
<span class="i0">A faithful guardian of my son’s affairs,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My husband’s bed respecting, and not less<br></span>
<span class="i0">My own fair fame, or whether I shall him<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all my suitors follow to his home<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who noblest seems, and offers richest dow’r.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My son while he was infant yet, and own’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l660" id="BXIX_l660"></a>660</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">An infant’s mind, could never give consent<br></span>
<span class="i0">That I should wed and leave him; but at length,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Since he hath reached the stature of a man,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He wishes my departure hence, the waste<br></span>
<span class="i0">Viewing indignant by the suitors made.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But I have dream’d. Hear, and expound my dream.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My geese are twenty, which within my walls<br></span>
<span class="i0">I feed with sodden wheat; they serve to amuse<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes my sorrow. From the mountains came<br></span>
<span class="i0">An eagle, huge, hook-beak’d, brake all their necks, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l670" id="BXIX_l670"></a>670</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And slew them; scatter’d on the palace-floor<br></span>
<span class="i0">They lay, and he soar’d swift into the skies.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dream only as it was, I wept aloud,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till all my maidens, gather’d by my voice,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arriving, found me weeping still, and still<br></span>
<span class="i0">Complaining, that the eagle had at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slain all my geese. But, to the palace-roof<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stooping again, he sat, and with a voice<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of human sound, forbad my tears, and said—<br></span>
<span class="i1">Courage! O daughter of the far-renown’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l680" id="BXIX_l680"></a>680</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Icarius! no vain dream thou hast beheld,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, in thy sleep, a truth. The slaughter’d geese<br></span>
<span class="i0">Denote thy suitors. I who have appear’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">An eagle in thy sight, am yet indeed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy husband, who have now, at last, return’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Death, horrid death designing for them all.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said; then waking at the voice, I cast<br></span>
<span class="i0">An anxious look around, and saw my geese<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside their tray, all feeding as before.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Her then Ulysses answer’d, ever-wise. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l690" id="BXIX_l690"></a>690</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">O Queen! it is not possible to miss<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy dream’s plain import, since Ulysses’ self<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath told thee the event; thy suitors all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Must perish; not one suitor shall escape.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Penelope discrete replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dreams are inexplicable, O my guest!<br></span>
<span class="i0">And oft-times mere delusions that receive<br></span>
<span class="i0">No just accomplishment. There are two gates<br></span>
<span class="i0">Through which the fleeting phantoms pass; of horn<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is one, and one of ivory.<a name="fnm_86" id="fnm_86"></a><a href="#fn_86" class="fnnum">86</a> Such dreams <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l700" id="BXIX_l700"></a>700</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">As through the thin-leaf’d iv’ry portal come<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sooth, but perform not, utt’ring empty sounds;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But such as through the polish’d horn escape,<br></span>
<span class="i0">If, haply seen by any mortal eye,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Prove faithful witnesses, and are fulfill’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But through those gates my wond’rous dream, I think,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Came not; thrice welcome were it else to me<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to my son. Now mark my words; attend.<br></span>
<span class="i0">This is the hated morn that from the house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Removes me of Ulysses. I shall fix, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l710" id="BXIX_l710"></a>710</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">This day, the rings for trial to them all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of archership; Ulysses’ custom was<br></span>
<span class="i0">To plant twelve spikes, all regular arranged<a name="fnm_87" id="fnm_87"></a><a href="#fn_87" class="fnnum">87</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">Like galley-props, and crested with a ring,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then standing far remote, true in his aim<br></span>
<span class="i0">He with his whizzing shaft would thrid them all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">This is the contest in which now I mean<br></span>
<span class="i0">To prove the suitors; him, who with most ease<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall bend the bow, and shoot through all the rings,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I follow, this dear mansion of my youth <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l720" id="BXIX_l720"></a>720</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving, so fair, so fill’d with ev’ry good,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Though still to love it even in my dreams.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Her answer’d then Ulysses, ever-wise.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Consort revered of Laertiades!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Postpone not this contention, but appoint<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forthwith the trial; for Ulysses here<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will sure arrive, ere they, (his polish’d bow<br></span>
<span class="i0">Long tamp’ring) shall prevail to stretch the nerve,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And speed the arrow through the iron rings.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Penelope replied discrete. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l730" id="BXIX_l730"></a>730</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Would’st thou with thy sweet converse, O my guest!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here sooth me still, sleep ne’er should influence<br></span>
<span class="i0">These eyes the while; but always to resist<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep’s pow’r is not for man, to whom the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Each circumstance of his condition here<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fix universally. Myself will seek<br></span>
<span class="i0">My own apartment at the palace-top,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And there will lay me down on my sad couch,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For such it hath been, and with tears of mine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ceaseless bedew’d, e’er since Ulysses went <span class="linenum"><a name="BXIX_l740" id="BXIX_l740"></a>740</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To that bad city, never to be named.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There will I sleep; but sleep thou here below,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Either, thyself, preparing on the ground<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy couch, or on a couch by these prepared.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, she to her splendid chamber thence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Retired, not sole, but by her female train<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attended; there arrived, she wept her spouse,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her lov’d Ulysses, till Minerva dropp’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The balm of slumber on her weary lids.<br></span>

A gaberdine is a shaggy cloak of coarse but warm materials.
Such always make part of Homer’s bed-furniture.</p>

Homer’s morals seem to allow to a good man dissimulation,
and even an ambiguous oath, should they be necessary to save him from a
villain. Thus in Book XX. Telemachus swears by Zeus, that he does not
hinder his mother from marrying whom she pleases of the wooers, though at
the same time he is plotting their destruction with his father. F.</p>

She intended to slay the son of her husband’s brother
Amphion, incited to it by the envy of his wife, who had six children,
while herself had only two, but through mistake she slew her own son
Itylus, and for her punishment was transformed by Jupiter into a
nightingale.</p>

The difference of the two substances may perhaps serve to
account for the preference given in this case to the gate of horn; horn
being transparent, and as such emblematical of truth, while ivory, from
its whiteness, promises light, but is, in fact, opaque. F.</p>

The translation here is somewhat pleonastic for the sake of
perspicuity; the original is clear in itself, but not to us who have no
such practice. Twelve stakes were fixt in the earth, each having a ring
at the top; the order in which they stood was so exact, that an arrow
sent with an even hand through the first ring, would pass them all.</p>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">Ulysses, doubting whether he shall destroy or not the women servants who
commit lewdness with the suitors, resolves at length to spare them for
the present. He asks an omen from Jupiter, and that he would grant him
also to hear some propitious words from the lips of one in the family.
His petitions are both answered. Preparation is made for the feast.
Whilst the suitors sit at table, Pallas smites them with a horrid frenzy.
Theoclymenus, observing the strange effects of it, prophesies their
destruction, and they deride his prophecy.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But in the vestibule the Hero lay<br></span>
<span class="i0">On a bull’s-hide undress’d, o’er which he spread<br></span>
<span class="i0">The fleece of many a sheep slain by the Greeks,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, cover’d by the household’s governess<br></span>
<span class="i0">With a wide cloak, composed himself to rest.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet slept he not, but meditating lay<br></span>
<span class="i0">Woe to his enemies. Meantime, the train<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of women, wonted to the suitors’ arms,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Issuing all mirth and laughter, in his soul<br></span>
<span class="i0">A tempest raised of doubts, whether at once <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l10" id="BXX_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To slay, or to permit them yet to give<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their lusty paramours one last embrace.<br></span>
<span class="i0">As growls the mastiff standing on the start<br></span>
<span class="i0">For battle, if a stranger’s foot approach<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her cubs new-whelp’d—so growl’d Ulysses’ heart,<br></span>
<span class="i0">While wonder fill’d him at their impious deeds.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, smiting on his breast, thus he reproved<br></span>
<span class="i0">The mutinous inhabitant within.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Heart! bear it. Worse than this thou didst endure<br></span>
<span class="i0">When, uncontroulable by force of man, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l20" id="BXX_l20"></a>20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The Cyclops thy illustrious friends devour’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy patience then fail’d not, till prudence found<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deliv’rance for thee on the brink of fate.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So disciplined the Hero his own heart,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which, tractable, endured the rigorous curb,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And patient; yet he turn’d from side to side.<br></span>
<span class="i0">As when some hungry swain turns oft a maw<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unctuous and sav’ry on the burning coals,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Quick expediting his desired repast,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So he from side to side roll’d, pond’ring deep <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l30" id="BXX_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">How likeliest with success he might assail<br></span>
<span class="i0">Those shameless suitors; one to many opposed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, sudden from the skies descending, came<br></span>
<span class="i0">Minerva in a female form; her stand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Above his head she took, and thus she spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Why sleep’st thou not, unhappiest of mankind?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art at home; here dwells thy wife, and here<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy son; a son, whom all might wish their own.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then her Ulysses answer’d, ever-wise.<br></span>
<span class="i0">O Goddess! true is all that thou hast said, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l40" id="BXX_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But, not without anxiety, I muse<br></span>
<span class="i0">How, single as I am, I shall assail<br></span>
<span class="i0">Those shameless suitors who frequent my courts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Daily; and always their whole multitude.<br></span>
<span class="i0">This weightier theme I meditate beside;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should I, with Jove’s concurrence and with thine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Prevail to slay them, how shall I escape,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself, at last?<a name="fnm_88" id="fnm_88"></a><a href="#fn_88" class="fnnum">88</a> oh Goddess, weigh it well.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d then Pallas cærulean-eyed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh faithless man! a man will in his friend <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l50" id="BXX_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Confide, though mortal, and in valour less<br></span>
<span class="i0">And wisdom than himself; but I who keep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thee in all difficulties, am divine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I tell thee plainly. Were we hemm’d around<br></span>
<span class="i0">By fifty troops of shouting warriors bent<br></span>
<span class="i0">To slay thee, thou should’st yet securely drive<br></span>
<span class="i0">The flocks away and cattle of them all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But yield to sleep’s soft influence; for to lie<br></span>
<span class="i0">All night thus watchful, is, itself, distress.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fear not. Deliv’rance waits, not far remote. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l60" id="BXX_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, she o’er Ulysses’ eyes diffused<br></span>
<span class="i0">Soft slumbers, and when sleep that sooths the mind<br></span>
<span class="i0">And nerves the limbs afresh had seized him once,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the Olympian summit swift return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But his chaste spouse awoke; she weeping sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">On her soft couch, and, noblest of her sex,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Satiate at length with tears, her pray’r address’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">First to Diana of the Pow’rs above.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Diana, awful progeny of Jove!<br></span>
<span class="i0">I would that with a shaft this moment sped <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l70" id="BXX_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Into my bosom, thou would’st here conclude<br></span>
<span class="i0">My mournful life! or, oh that, as it flies,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Snatching me through the pathless air, a storm<br></span>
<span class="i0">Would whelm me deep in Ocean’s restless tide!<br></span>
<span class="i0">So, when the Gods their parents had destroy’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Storms suddenly the beauteous daughters snatch’d<a name="fnm_89" id="fnm_89"></a><a href="#fn_89" class="fnnum">89</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Pandarus away; them left forlorn<br></span>
<span class="i0">Venus with curds, with honey and with wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fed duly; Juno gave them to surpass<br></span>
<span class="i0">All women in the charms of face and mind, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l80" id="BXX_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With graceful stature eminent the chaste<br></span>
<span class="i0">Diana bless’d them, and in works of art<br></span>
<span class="i0">Illustrious, Pallas taught them to excel.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when the foam-sprung Goddess to the skies<br></span>
<span class="i0">A suitress went on their behalf, to obtain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Blest nuptials for them from the Thund’rer Jove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(For Jove the happiness, himself, appoints,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the unhappiness of all below)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, the Harpies ravishing away<br></span>
<span class="i0">Those virgins, gave them to the Furies Three, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l90" id="BXX_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That they might serve them. O that me the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Inhabiting Olympus so would hide<br></span>
<span class="i0">From human eyes for ever, or bright-hair’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Diana pierce me with a shaft, that while<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses yet engages all my thoughts,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My days concluded, I might ’scape the pain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of gratifying some inferior Chief!<br></span>
<span class="i0">This is supportable, when (all the day<br></span>
<span class="i0">To sorrow giv’n) the mourner sleeps at night;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For sleep, when it hath once the eyelids veil’d, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l100" id="BXX_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">All reminiscence blots of all alike,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both good and ill; but me the Gods afflict<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not seldom ev’n in dreams, and at my side,<br></span>
<span class="i0">This night again, one lay resembling him;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such as my own Ulysses when he join’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Achaia’s warriors; my exulting heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">No airy dream believed it, but a truth.<br></span>
<span class="i1">While thus she spake, in orient gold enthroned<br></span>
<span class="i0">Came forth the morn; Ulysses, as she wept,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heard plain her lamentation; him that sound <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l110" id="BXX_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Alarm’d; he thought her present, and himself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Known to her. Gath’ring hastily the cloak<br></span>
<span class="i0">His cov’ring, and the fleeces, them he placed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Together on a throne within the hall,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But bore the bull’s-hide forth into the air.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, lifting high his hands to Jove, he pray’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Eternal Sire! if over moist and dry<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ye have with good-will sped me to my home<br></span>
<span class="i0">After much suff’ring, grant me from the lips<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of some domestic now awake, to hear <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l120" id="BXX_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Words of propitious omen, and thyself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Vouchsafe me still some other sign abroad.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Such pray’r he made, and Jove omniscient heard.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sudden he thunder’d from the radiant heights<br></span>
<span class="i0">Olympian; glad, Ulysses heard the sound.<br></span>
<span class="i0">A woman, next, a labourer at the mill<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hard by, where all the palace-mills were wrought,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gave him the omen of propitious sound.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Twelve maidens, day by day, toil’d at the mills,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meal grinding, some, of barley, some, of wheat, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l130" id="BXX_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Marrow of man.<a name="fnm_90" id="fnm_90"></a><a href="#fn_90" class="fnnum">90</a> The rest (their portion ground)<br></span>
<span class="i0">All slept; she only from her task as yet<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ceas’d not, for she was feeblest of them all;<br></span>
<span class="i0">She rested on her mill, and thus pronounced<br></span>
<span class="i0">The happy omen by her Lord desired.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Jove, Father, Governor of heav’n and earth!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Loud thou hast thunder’d from the starry skies<br></span>
<span class="i0">By no cloud veil’d; a sign propitious, giv’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">To whom I know not; but oh grant the pray’r<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of a poor bond-woman! appoint their feast <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l140" id="BXX_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">This day, the last that in Ulysses’ house<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors shall enjoy, for whom I drudge,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With aching heart and trembling knees their meal<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grinding continual. Feast they here no more!<br></span>
<span class="i1">She ended, and the list’ning Chief received<br></span>
<span class="i0">With equal joy both signs; for well he hoped<br></span>
<span class="i0">That he should punish soon those guilty men.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now the other maidens in the hall<br></span>
<span class="i0">Assembling, kindled on the hearth again<br></span>
<span class="i0">Th’ unwearied blaze; then, godlike from his couch <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l150" id="BXX_l150"></a>150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Arose Telemachus, and, fresh-attired,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Athwart his shoulders his bright faulchion slung,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bound his fair sandals to his feet, and took<br></span>
<span class="i0">His sturdy spear pointed with glitt’ring brass;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Advancing to the portal, there he stood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Euryclea thus, his nurse, bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Nurse! have ye with respectful notice serv’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our guest? or hath he found a sordid couch<br></span>
<span class="i0">E’en where he might? for, prudent though she be,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My mother, inattentive oft, the worse <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l160" id="BXX_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Treats kindly, and the better sends away.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Whom Euryclea answer’d, thus, discrete.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Blame not, my son! who merits not thy blame.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The guest sat drinking till he would no more,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And ate, till, question’d, he replied—Enough.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when the hour of sleep call’d him to rest,<br></span>
<span class="i0">She gave commandment to her female train<br></span>
<span class="i0">To spread his couch. Yet he, like one forlorn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, through despair, indiff’rent to himself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both bed and rugs refused, and in the porch <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l170" id="BXX_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">On skins of sheep and on an undress’d hide<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reposed, where we threw cov’ring over him.<br></span>
<span class="i1">She ceas’d, and, grasping his bright-headed spear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forth went the Prince attended, as he went,<br></span>
<span class="i0">By his fleet hounds; to the assembled Greeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">In council with majestic gait he moved,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Euryclea, daughter wise of Ops,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pisenor’s son, call’d to the serving-maids.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Haste ye! be diligent! sweep the palace-floor<br></span>
<span class="i0">And sprinkle it; then give the sumptuous seats <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l180" id="BXX_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Their purple coverings. Let others cleanse<br></span>
<span class="i0">With sponges all the tables, wash and rince<br></span>
<span class="i0">The beakers well, and goblets rich-emboss’d;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Run others to the fountain, and bring thence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Water with speed. The suitors will not long<br></span>
<span class="i0">Be absent, but will early come to-day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For this day is a public festival.<a name="fnm_91" id="fnm_91"></a><a href="#fn_91" class="fnnum">91</a><br></span>
<span class="i1">So she; whom all, obedient, heard; forth went<br></span>
<span class="i0">Together, twenty to the crystal fount,<br></span>
<span class="i0">While in their sev’ral provinces the rest <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l190" id="BXX_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Bestirr’d them brisk at home. Then enter’d all<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors, and began cleaving the wood.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, the women from the fountain came,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom soon the swine-herd follow’d, driving three<br></span>
<span class="i0">His fattest brawns; them in the spacious court<br></span>
<span class="i0">He feeding left, and to Ulysses’ side<br></span>
<span class="i0">Approaching, courteously bespake the Chief.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Guest! look the Greecians on thee with respect<br></span>
<span class="i0">At length, or still disdainful as before?<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then, answer thus Ulysses wise return’d. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l200" id="BXX_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Yes—and I would that vengeance from the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Might pay their insolence, who in a house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not theirs, dominion exercise, and plan<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unseemly projects, shameless as they are!<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus they conferr’d; and now Melanthius came<br></span>
<span class="i0">The goat-herd, driving, with the aid of two<br></span>
<span class="i0">His fellow-swains, the fattest of his goats<br></span>
<span class="i0">To feast the suitors. In the sounding porch<br></span>
<span class="i0">The goats he tied, then, drawing near, in terms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reproachful thus assail’d Ulysses’ ear. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l210" id="BXX_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">How, stranger? persever’st thou, begging, still<br></span>
<span class="i0">To vex the suitors? wilt thou not depart?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce shall we settle this dispute, I judge,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till we have tasted each the other’s fist;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art unreasonable thus to beg<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here always—have the Greeks no feasts beside?<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake, to whom Ulysses answer none<br></span>
<span class="i0">Return’d, but shook his brows, and, silent, framed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Terrible purposes. Then, third, approach’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Chief o’er the herds, Philœtius; fatted goats <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l220" id="BXX_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">He for the suitors brought, with which he drove<br></span>
<span class="i0">An heifer; (ferry-men had pass’d them o’er,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Carriers of all who on their coast arrive)<br></span>
<span class="i0">He tied them in the sounding porch, then stood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the swine-herd, to whom thus he said.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Who is this guest, Eumæus, here arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">So lately? from what nation hath he come?<br></span>
<span class="i0">What parentage and country boasts the man?<br></span>
<span class="i0">I pity him, whose figure seems to speak<br></span>
<span class="i0">Royalty in him. Heav’n will surely plunge <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l230" id="BXX_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The race of common wand’rers deep in woe,<br></span>
<span class="i0">If thus it destine even Kings to mourn.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceas’d; and, with his right hand, drawing nigh,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Welcom’d Ulysses, whom he thus bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Hail venerable guest! and be thy lot<br></span>
<span class="i0">Prosp’rous at least hereafter, who art held<br></span>
<span class="i0">At present in the bonds of num’rous ills.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, Jupiter, of all the Gods, art most<br></span>
<span class="i0">Severe, and spar’st not to inflict distress<br></span>
<span class="i0">Even on creatures from thyself derived.<a name="fnm_92" id="fnm_92"></a><a href="#fn_92" class="fnnum">92</a> <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l240" id="BXX_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I had no sooner mark’d thee, than my eyes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Swam, and the sweat gush’d from me at the thought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of dear Ulysses; for if yet he live<br></span>
<span class="i0">And see the sun, such tatters, I suppose,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He wears, a wand’rer among human-kind.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But if already with the dead he dwell<br></span>
<span class="i0">In Pluto’s drear abode, oh then, alas<br></span>
<span class="i0">For kind Ulysses! who consign’d to me,<br></span>
<span class="i0">While yet a boy, his Cephalenian herds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And they have now encreas’d to such a store <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l250" id="BXX_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Innumerable of broad-fronted beeves,<br></span>

<span class="i0">These, by command of others, I transport<br></span>
<span class="i0">For their regale, who neither heed his son,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor tremble at the anger of the Gods,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But long have wish’d ardently to divide<br></span>
<span class="i0">And share the substance of our absent Lord.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Me, therefore, this thought occupies, and haunts<br></span>
<span class="i0">My mind not seldom; while the heir survives<br></span>
<span class="i0">It were no small offence to drive his herds <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l260" id="BXX_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Afar, and migrate to a foreign land;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet here to dwell, suff’ring oppressive wrongs<br></span>
<span class="i0">While I attend another’s beeves, appears<br></span>
<span class="i0">Still less supportable; and I had fled,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I had served some other mighty Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Long since, (for patience fails me to endure<br></span>
<span class="i0">My present lot) but that I cherish still<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some hope of my ill-fated Lord’s return,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To rid his palace of those lawless guests.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l270" id="BXX_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Herdsman! since neither void of sense thou seem’st,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet dishonest, but myself am sure<br></span>
<span class="i0">That thou art owner of a mind discrete,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hear therefore, for I swear! bold I attest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Jove and this hospitable board, and these<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Lares<a name="fnm_93" id="fnm_93"></a><a href="#fn_93" class="fnnum">93</a> of the noble Chief, whose hearth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Protects me now, that, ere thy going hence,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses surely shall have reach’d his home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thou shalt see him, if thou wilt, thyself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slaying the suitors who now lord it here. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l280" id="BXX_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d then the keeper of his beeves.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh stranger! would but the Saturnian King<br></span>
<span class="i0">Perform that word, thou should’st be taught (thyself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eye-witness of it) what an arm is mine.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Eumæus also ev’ry power of heav’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">Entreated, that Ulysses might possess<br></span>
<span class="i0">His home again. Thus mutual they conferr’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Meantime, in conf’rence close the suitors plann’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Death for Telemachus; but while they sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Consulting, on their left the bird of Jove <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l290" id="BXX_l290"></a>290</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">An eagle soar’d, grasping a tim’rous dove.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, thus, Amphinomus the rest bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Oh friends! our consultation how to slay<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus, will never smoothly run<br></span>
<span class="i0">To its effect; but let us to the feast.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake Amphinomus, whose counsel pleased.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, all into the royal house repaired,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And on the thrones and couches throwing off<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their mantles, slew the fatted goats, the brawns,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sheep full-sized, and heifer of the herd. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l300" id="BXX_l300"></a>300</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The roasted entrails first they shared, then fill’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The beakers, and the swine-herd placed the cups,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Philœtius, chief intendant of the beeves,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Served all with baskets elegant of bread,<br></span>
<span class="i0">While all their cups Melanthius charged with wine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And they assail’d at once the ready feast.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime Telemachus, with forecast shrewd,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fast by the marble threshold, but within<br></span>
<span class="i0">The spacious hall his father placed, to whom<br></span>
<span class="i0">A sordid seat he gave and scanty board. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l310" id="BXX_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A portion of the entrails, next, he set<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before him, fill’d a golden goblet high,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thus, in presence of them all, began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">There seated now, drink as the suitors drink.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will, myself, their biting taunts forbid,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And violence. This edifice is mine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not public property; my father first<br></span>
<span class="i0">Possess’d it, and my right from him descends.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Suitors! controul your tongues, nor with your hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">Offend, lest contest fierce and war ensue. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l320" id="BXX_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceas’d: they gnawing, sat, their lips, aghast<br></span>
<span class="i0">With wonder that Telemachus in his speech<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such boldness used. Then spake Eupithes’ son,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Antinoüs, and the assembly thus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Let pass, ye Greeks! the language of the Prince,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Harsh as it is, and big with threats to us.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had Jove permitted, his orations here,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Although thus eloquent, ere now had ceased.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake Antinoüs, whom Ulysses’ son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heard unconcern’d. And now the heralds came <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l330" id="BXX_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">In solemn pomp, conducting through the streets<br></span>
<span class="i0">A sacred hecatomb, when in the grove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Umbrageous of Apollo, King shaft-arm’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The assembled Greecians met. The sav’ry roast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Finish’d, and from the spits withdrawn, each shared<br></span>
<span class="i0">His portion of the noble feast, and such<br></span>
<span class="i0">As they enjoy’d themselves the attendants placed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before Ulysses, for the Hero’s son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself, Telemachus, had so enjoined.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But Pallas (that they might exasp’rate more <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l340" id="BXX_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses) suffer’d not the suitor Chiefs<br></span>
<span class="i0">To banquet, guiltless of heart-piercing scoffs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Malign. There was a certain suitor named<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ctesippus, born in Samos; base of mind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was he and profligate, but, in the wealth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Confiding of his father, woo’d the wife<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of long-exiled Ulysses. From his seat<br></span>
<span class="i0">The haughty suitors thus that man address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ye noble suitors, I would speak; attend!<br></span>
<span class="i0">The guest is served; he hath already shared <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l350" id="BXX_l350"></a>350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Equal with us; nor less the laws demand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of hospitality; for neither just<br></span>
<span class="i0">It were nor decent, that a guest, received<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here by Telemachus, should be denied<br></span>
<span class="i0">His portion of the feast. Come then—myself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will give to him, that he may also give<br></span>
<span class="i0">To her who laved him in the bath, or else<br></span>
<span class="i0">To whatsoever menial here he will.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he from a basket near at hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heav’d an ox-foot, and with a vig’rous arm <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l360" id="BXX_l360"></a>360</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Hurl’d it. Ulysses gently bow’d his head,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shunning the blow, but gratified his just<br></span>
<span class="i0">Resentment with a broad sardonic smile<a name="fnm_94" id="fnm_94"></a><a href="#fn_94" class="fnnum">94</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of dread significance. He smote the wall.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus Telemachus rebuked the deed.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ctesippus, thou art fortunate; the bone<br></span>
<span class="i0">Struck not the stranger, for he shunn’d the blow;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Else, I had surely thrust my glitt’ring lance<br></span>
<span class="i0">Right through thee; then, no hymenæal rites<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of thine should have employ’d thy father here, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l370" id="BXX_l370"></a>370</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But thy funereal. No man therefore treat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Me with indignity within these walls,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For though of late a child, I can discern<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now, and distinguish between good and ill.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Suffice it that we patiently endure<br></span>
<span class="i0">To be spectators daily of our sheep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slaughter’d, our bread consumed, our stores of wine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wasted; for what can one to all opposed?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Come then—persist no longer in offence<br></span>
<span class="i0">And hostile hate of me; or if ye wish <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l380" id="BXX_l380"></a>380</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To slay me, pause not. It were better far<br></span>
<span class="i0">To die, and I had rather much be slain,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Than thus to witness your atrocious deeds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Day after day; to see our guests abused,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With blows insulted, and the women dragg’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With a licentious violence obscene<br></span>
<span class="i0">From side to side of all this fair abode.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and all sat silent, till at length<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Agelaüs spake, Diastor’s son.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My friends! let none with contradiction thwart <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l390" id="BXX_l390"></a>390</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And rude reply, words rational and just;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Assault no more the stranger, nor of all<br></span>
<span class="i0">The servants of renown’d Ulysses here<br></span>
<span class="i0">Harm any. My advice, both to the Queen<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to Telemachus, shall gentle be,<br></span>
<span class="i0">May it but please them. While the hope survived<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within your bosoms of the safe return<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of wise Ulysses to his native isle,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So long good reason was that she should use<br></span>
<span class="i0">Delay, and hold our wooing in suspence; <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l400" id="BXX_l400"></a>400</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For had Ulysses come, that course had proved<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wisest and best; but that he comes no more<br></span>
<span class="i0">Appears, now, manifest. Thou, therefore, Prince!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seeking thy mother, counsel her to wed<br></span>
<span class="i0">The noblest, and who offers richest dow’r,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That thou, for thy peculiar, may’st enjoy<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy own inheritance in peace and ease,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And she, departing, find another home.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I swear by Jove, and by my father’s woes, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l410" id="BXX_l410"></a>410</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Who either hath deceased far from his home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or lives a wand’rer, that I interpose<br></span>
<span class="i0">No hindrance to her nuptials. Let her wed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who offers most, and even whom she will.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But to dismiss her rudely were a deed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unfilial—That I dare not—God forbid!<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake Telemachus. Then Pallas struck<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors with delirium; wide they stretch’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their jaws with unspontaneous laughter loud;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their meat dripp’d blood; tears fill’d their eyes, and dire<br></span>
<span class="i0">Presages of approaching woe, their hearts. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l421" id="BXX_l421"></a>421</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus the prophet Theoclymenus.<a name="fnm_95" id="fnm_95"></a><a href="#fn_95" class="fnnum">95</a><br></span>
<span class="i1">Ah miserable men! what curse is this<br></span>
<span class="i0">That takes you now? night wraps itself around<br></span>
<span class="i0">Your faces, bodies, limbs; the palace shakes<br></span>
<span class="i0">With peals of groans—and oh, what floods ye weep!<br></span>
<span class="i0">I see the walls and arches dappled thick<br></span>
<span class="i0">With gore; the vestibule is throng’d, the court<br></span>
<span class="i0">On all sides throng’d with apparitions grim<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of slaughter’d men sinking into the gloom <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l430" id="BXX_l430"></a>430</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Erebus; the sun is blotted out<br></span>
<span class="i0">From heav’n, and midnight whelms you premature.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, they, hearing, laugh’d; and thus the son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Polybus, Eurymachus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">This wand’rer from a distant shore hath left<br></span>
<span class="i0">His wits behind. Hoa there! conduct him hence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into the forum; since he dreams it night<br></span>
<span class="i0">Already, teach him there that it is day.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer’d godlike Theoclymenus.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I have no need, Eurymachus, of guides <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l440" id="BXX_l440"></a>440</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To lead me hence, for I have eyes and ears,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The use of both my feet, and of a mind<br></span>
<span class="i0">In no respect irrational or wild.<br></span>
<span class="i0">These shall conduct me forth, for well I know<br></span>
<span class="i0">That evil threatens you, such, too, as none<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall ’scape of all the suitors, whose delight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is to insult the unoffending guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Received beneath this hospitable roof.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and, issuing from the palace, sought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Piræus’ house, who gladly welcom’d him. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l450" id="BXX_l450"></a>450</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then all the suitors on each other cast<br></span>
<span class="i0">A look significant, and, to provoke<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus the more, fleer’d at his guests.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of whom a youth thus, insolent began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">No living wight, Telemachus, had e’er<br></span>
<span class="i0">Guests such as thine. Witness, we know not who,<br></span>
<span class="i0">This hungry vagabond, whose means of life<br></span>
<span class="i0">Are none, and who hath neither skill nor force<br></span>
<span class="i0">To earn them, a mere burthen on the ground.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Witness the other also, who upstarts <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l460" id="BXX_l460"></a>460</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A prophet suddenly. Take my advice;<br></span>
<span class="i0">I counsel wisely; send them both on board<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some gallant bark to Sicily for sale;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus shall they somewhat profit thee at last.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake the suitors, whom Telemachus<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heard unconcern’d, and, silent, look’d and look’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Toward his father, watching still the time<br></span>
<span class="i0">When he should punish that licentious throng.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, Icarius’ daughter, who had placed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her splendid seat opposite, heard distinct <span class="linenum"><a name="BXX_l470" id="BXX_l470"></a>470</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Their taunting speeches. They, with noisy mirth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Feasted deliciously, for they had slain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Many a fat victim; but a sadder feast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Than, soon, the Goddess and the warrior Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should furnish for them, none shall ever share.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of which their crimes had furnish’d first the cause.<br></span>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">Penelope proposes to the suitors a contest with the bow, herself the
prize. They prove unable to bend the bow; when Ulysses having with some
difficulty possessed himself of it, manages it with the utmost ease, and
dispatches his arrow through twelve rings erected for the trial.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Minerva, now, Goddess cærulean-eyed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Prompted Icarius’ daughter, the discrete<br></span>
<span class="i0">Penelope, with bow and rings to prove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her suitors in Ulysses’ courts, a game<br></span>
<span class="i0">Terrible in conclusion to them all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">First, taking in her hand the brazen key<br></span>
<span class="i0">Well-forged, and fitted with an iv’ry grasp,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attended by the women of her train<br></span>
<span class="i0">She sought her inmost chamber, the recess<br></span>
<span class="i0">In which she kept the treasures of her Lord, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l10" id="BXXI_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His brass, his gold, and steel elaborate.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here lay his stubborn bow, and quiver fill’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With num’rous shafts, a fatal store. That bow<br></span>
<span class="i0">He had received and quiver from the hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of godlike Iphitus Eurytides,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom, in Messenia,<a name="fnm_96" id="fnm_96"></a><a href="#fn_96" class="fnnum">96</a> in the house he met<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of brave Orsilochus. Ulysses came<br></span>
<span class="i0">Demanding payment of arrearage due<br></span>
<span class="i0">From all that land; for a Messenian fleet<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had borne from Ithaca three hundred sheep, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l20" id="BXXI_l20"></a>20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With all their shepherds; for which cause, ere yet<br></span>
<span class="i0">Adult, he voyaged to that distant shore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deputed by his sire, and by the Chiefs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ithaca, to make the just demand.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But Iphitus had thither come to seek<br></span>
<span class="i0">Twelve mares and twelve mule colts which he had lost,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A search that cost him soon a bloody death.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For, coming to the house of Hercules<br></span>
<span class="i0">The valiant task-performing son of Jove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He perish’d there, slain by his cruel host <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l30" id="BXXI_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, heedless of heav’n’s wrath, and of the rights<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of his own board, first fed, then slaughter’d him;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For in <i>his</i> house the mares and colts were hidden.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He, therefore, occupied in that concern,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meeting Ulysses there, gave him the bow<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which, erst, huge Eurytus had borne, and which<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself had from his dying sire received.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, in return, on him bestowed<br></span>
<span class="i0">A spear and sword, pledges of future love<br></span>
<span class="i0">And hospitality; but never more <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l40" id="BXXI_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">They met each other at the friendly board,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For, ere that hour arrived, the son of Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slew his own guest, the godlike Iphitus.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus came the bow into Ulysses’ hands,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which, never in his gallant barks he bore<br></span>
<span class="i0">To battle with him, (though he used it oft<br></span>
<span class="i0">In times of peace) but left it safely stored<br></span>
<span class="i0">At home, a dear memorial of his friend.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Soon as, divinest of her sex, arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">At that same chamber, with her foot she press’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l50" id="BXXI_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The oaken threshold bright, on which the hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of no mean architect had stretch’d the line,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who had erected also on each side<br></span>
<span class="i0">The posts on which the splendid portals hung,<br></span>
<span class="i0">She loos’d the ring and brace, then introduced<br></span>
<span class="i0">The key, and aiming at them from without,<a name="fnm_97" id="fnm_97"></a><a href="#fn_97" class="fnnum">97</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">Struck back the bolts. The portals, at that stroke,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sent forth a tone deep as the pastur’d bull’s,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And flew wide open. She, ascending, next,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The elevated floor on which the chests <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l60" id="BXXI_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That held her own fragrant apparel stood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With lifted hand aloft took down the bow<br></span>
<span class="i0">In its embroider’d bow-case safe enclosed.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, sitting there, she lay’d it on her knees,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Weeping aloud, and drew it from the case.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus weeping over it long time she sat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till satiate, at the last, with grief and tears,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Descending by the palace steps she sought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Again the haughty suitors, with the bow<br></span>
<span class="i0">Elastic, and the quiver in her hand <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l70" id="BXXI_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Replete with pointed shafts, a deadly store.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her maidens, as she went, bore after her<br></span>
<span class="i0">A coffer fill’d with prizes by her Lord,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Much brass and steel; and when at length she came,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Loveliest of women, where the suitors sat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Between the pillars of the stately dome<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pausing, before her beauteous face she held<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her lucid veil, and by two matrons chaste<br></span>
<span class="i0">Supported, the assembly thus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ye noble suitors hear, who rudely haunt <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l80" id="BXXI_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">This palace of a Chief long absent hence,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose substance ye have now long time consumed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor palliative have yet contrived, or could,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Save your ambition to make me a bride—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attend this game to which I call you forth.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now suitors! prove yourselves with this huge bow<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of wide-renown’d Ulysses; he who draws<br></span>
<span class="i0">Easiest the bow, and who his arrow sends<br></span>
<span class="i0">Through twice six rings, he takes me to his home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I must leave this mansion of my youth <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l90" id="BXXI_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Plenteous, magnificent, which, doubtless, oft<br></span>
<span class="i0">I shall remember even in my dreams.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, she bade Eumæus lay the bow<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before them, and the twice six rings of steel.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He wept, received them, and obey’d; nor wept<br></span>
<span class="i0">The herdsman less, seeing the bow which erst<br></span>
<span class="i0">His Lord had occupied; when at their tears<br></span>
<span class="i0">Indignant, thus, Antinoüs began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ye rural drones, whose purblind eyes see not<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the present hour, egregious fools! <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l100" id="BXXI_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Why weeping trouble ye the Queen, too much<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before afflicted for her husband lost?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Either partake the banquet silently,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or else go weep abroad, leaving the bow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That stubborn test, to us; for none, I judge,<br></span>
<span class="i0">None here shall bend this polish’d bow with ease,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Since in this whole assembly I discern<br></span>
<span class="i0">None like Ulysses, whom myself have seen<br></span>
<span class="i0">And recollect, though I was then a boy.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, but in his heart, meantime, the hope <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l110" id="BXXI_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Cherish’d, that he should bend, himself, the bow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And pass the rings; yet was he destin’d first<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all that company to taste the steel<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of brave Ulysses’ shaft, whom in that house<br></span>
<span class="i0">He had so oft dishonour’d, and had urged<br></span>
<span class="i0">So oft all others to the like offence.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst them, then, the sacred might arose<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of young Telemachus, who thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Saturnian Jove questionless hath deprived<br></span>
<span class="i0">Me of all reason. My own mother, fam’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l120" id="BXXI_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For wisdom as she is, makes known to all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her purpose to abandon this abode<br></span>
<span class="i0">And follow a new mate, while, heedless, I<br></span>
<span class="i0">Trifle and laugh as I were still a child.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But come, ye suitors! since the prize is such,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A woman like to whom none can be found<br></span>
<span class="i0">This day in all Achaia; on the shores<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of sacred Pylus; in the cities proud<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Argos or Mycenæ; or even here<br></span>
<span class="i0">In Ithaca; or yet within the walls <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l130" id="BXXI_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of black Epirus; and since this yourselves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Know also, wherefore should I speak her praise?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Come then, delay not, waste not time in vain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Excuses, turn not from the proof, but bend<br></span>
<span class="i0">The bow, that thus the issue may be known.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I also will, myself, that task essay;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And should I bend the bow, and pass the rings,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then shall not my illustrious mother leave<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her son forlorn, forsaking this abode<br></span>
<span class="i0">To follow a new spouse, while I remain <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l140" id="BXXI_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Disconsolate, although of age to bear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Successful as my sire, the prize away.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he started from his seat, cast off<br></span>
<span class="i0">His purple cloak, and lay’d his sword aside,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then fix’d, himself, the rings, furrowing the earth<br></span>
<span class="i0">By line, and op’ning one long trench for all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And stamping close the glebe. Amazement seized<br></span>
<span class="i0">All present, seeing with how prompt a skill<br></span>
<span class="i0">He executed, though untaught, his task.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, hasting to the portal, there he stood. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l150" id="BXXI_l150"></a>150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice, struggling, he essay’d to bend the bow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thrice desisted, hoping still to draw<br></span>
<span class="i0">The bow-string home, and shoot through all the rings.<a name="fnm_98" id="fnm_98"></a><a href="#fn_98" class="fnnum">98</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">And now the fourth time striving with full force<br></span>
<span class="i0">He had prevail’d to string it, but his sire<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forbad his eager efforts by a sign.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus the royal youth to all around—<br></span>
<span class="i1">Gods! either I shall prove of little force<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hereafter, and for manly feats unapt,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or I am yet too young, and have not strength <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l160" id="BXXI_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To quell the aggressor’s contumely. But come—<br></span>
<span class="i0">(For ye have strength surpassing mine) try ye<br></span>
<span class="i0">The bow, and bring this contest to an end.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceas’d, and set the bow down on the floor,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reclining it against the shaven pannels smooth<br></span>
<span class="i0">That lined the wall; the arrow next he placed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Leaning against the bow’s bright-polish’d horn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to the seat, whence he had ris’n, return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus Eupithes’ son, Antinoüs spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My friends! come forth successive from the right,<a name="fnm_99" id="fnm_99"></a><a href="#fn_99" class="fnnum">99</a> <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l170" id="BXXI_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Where he who ministers the cup begins.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake Antinoüs, and his counsel pleased.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, first, Leiodes, Œnop’s son, arose.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He was their soothsayer, and ever sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the beaker, inmost of them all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">To him alone, of all, licentious deeds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Were odious, and, with indignation fired,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He witness’d the excesses of the rest.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He then took foremost up the shaft and bow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, station’d at the portal, strove to bend <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l180" id="BXXI_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But bent it not, fatiguing, first, his hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">Delicate and uncustom’d to the toil.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He ceased, and the assembly thus bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My friends, I speed not; let another try;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For many Princes shall this bow of life<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bereave, since death more eligible seems,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Far more, than loss of her, for whom we meet<br></span>
<span class="i0">Continual here, expecting still the prize.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some suitor, haply, at this moment, hopes<br></span>
<span class="i0">That he shall wed whom long he hath desired, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l190" id="BXXI_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses’ wife, Penelope; let him<br></span>
<span class="i0">Essay the bow, and, trial made, address<br></span>
<span class="i0">His spousal offers to some other fair<br></span>
<span class="i0">Among the long-stoled Princesses of Greece,<br></span>
<span class="i0">This Princess leaving his, whose proffer’d gifts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall please her most, and whom the Fates ordain.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and set the bow down on the floor,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reclining it against the shaven pannels smooth<br></span>
<span class="i0">That lined the wall; the arrow, next, he placed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Leaning against the bow’s bright-polish’d horn, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l200" id="BXXI_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And to the seat whence he had ris’n return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then him Antinoüs, angry, thus reproved.<br></span>
<span class="i1">What word, Leiodes, grating to our ears<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath scap’d thy lips? I hear it with disdain.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall this bow fatal prove to many a Prince,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Because thou hast, thyself, too feeble proved<br></span>
<span class="i0">To bend it? no. Thou wast not born to bend<br></span>
<span class="i0">The unpliant bow, or to direct the shaft,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But here are nobler who shall soon prevail.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and to Melanthius gave command, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l210" id="BXXI_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The goat-herd. Hence, Melanthius, kindle fire;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside it place, with fleeces spread, a form<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of length commodious; from within procure<br></span>
<span class="i0">A large round cake of suet next, with which<br></span>
<span class="i0">When we have chafed and suppled the tough bow<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before the fire, we will again essay<br></span>
<span class="i0">To bend it, and decide the doubtful strife.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, and Melanthius, kindling fire<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside it placed, with fleeces spread, a form<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of length commodious; next, he brought a cake <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l220" id="BXXI_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ample and round of suet from within,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With which they chafed the bow, then tried again<br></span>
<span class="i0">To bend, but bent it not; superior strength<br></span>
<span class="i0">To theirs that task required. Yet two, the rest<br></span>
<span class="i0">In force surpassing, made no trial yet,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Antinoüs, and Eurymachus the brave.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then went the herdsman and the swine-herd forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Together; after whom, the glorious Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself the house left also, and when all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Without the court had met, with gentle speech <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l230" id="BXXI_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, then, the faithful pair address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Herdsman! and thou, Eumæus! shall I keep<br></span>
<span class="i0">A certain secret close, or shall I speak<br></span>
<span class="i0">Outright? my spirit prompts me, and I will.<br></span>
<span class="i0">What welcome should Ulysses at your hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">Receive, arriving suddenly at home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some God his guide; would ye the suitors aid,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or would ye aid Ulysses? answer true.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then thus the chief intendant of his herds.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Would Jove but grant me my desire, to see <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l240" id="BXXI_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Once more the Hero, and would some kind Pow’r,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Restore him, I would shew thee soon an arm<br></span>
<span class="i0">Strenuous to serve him, and a dauntless heart.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Eumæus, also, fervently implored<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Gods in pray’r, that they would render back<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses to his home. He, then, convinced<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of their unfeigning honesty, began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Behold him! I am he myself, arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">After long suff’rings in the twentieth year!<br></span>
<span class="i0">I know how welcome to yourselves alone <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l250" id="BXXI_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all my train I come, for I have heard<br></span>
<span class="i0">None others praying for my safe return.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I therefore tell you truth; should heav’n subdue<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors under me, ye shall receive<br></span>
<span class="i0">Each at my hands a bride, with lands and house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Near to my own, and ye shall be thenceforth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dear friends and brothers of the Prince my son.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lo! also this indisputable proof<br></span>
<span class="i0">That ye may know and trust me. View it here.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It is the scar which in Parnassus erst <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l260" id="BXXI_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">(Where with the sons I hunted of renown’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Autolycus) I from a boar received.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he stripp’d his tatters, and unveil’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The whole broad scar; then, soon as they had seen<br></span>
<span class="i0">And surely recognized the mark, each cast<br></span>
<span class="i0">His arms around Ulysses, wept, embraced<br></span>
<span class="i0">And press’d him to his bosom, kissing oft<br></span>
<span class="i0">His brows and shoulders, who as oft their hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">And foreheads kiss’d, nor had the setting sun<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld them satisfied, but that himself <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l270" id="BXXI_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses thus admonished them, and said.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Cease now from tears, lest any, coming forth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mark and report them to our foes within.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now, to the hall again, but one by one,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not all at once, I foremost, then yourselves,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And this shall be the sign. Full well I know<br></span>
<span class="i0">That, all unanimous, they will oppose<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deliv’ry of the bow and shafts to me;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But thou, (proceeding with it to my seat)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eumæus, noble friend! shalt give the bow <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l280" id="BXXI_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Into my grasp; then bid the women close<br></span>
<span class="i0">The massy doors, and should they hear a groan<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or other noise made by the Princes shut<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within the hall, let none set step abroad,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But all work silent. Be the palace-door<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy charge, my good Philœtius! key it fast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Without a moment’s pause, and fix the brace.<a name="fnm_100" id="fnm_100"></a><a href="#fn_100" class="fnnum">100</a><br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, and, returning to the hall,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Resumed his seat; nor stay’d his servants long<br></span>
<span class="i0">Without, but follow’d their illustrious Lord. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l290" id="BXXI_l290"></a>290</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Eurymachus was busily employ’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Turning the bow, and chafing it before<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sprightly blaze, but, after all, could find<br></span>
<span class="i0">No pow’r to bend it. Disappointment wrung<br></span>
<span class="i0">A groan from his proud heart, and thus he said.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Alas! not only for myself I grieve,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But grieve for all. Nor, though I mourn the loss<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of such a bride, mourn I that loss alone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(For lovely Greecians may be found no few<br></span>
<span class="i0">In Ithaca, and in the neighbour isles) <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l300" id="BXXI_l300"></a>300</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But should we so inferior prove at last<br></span>
<span class="i0">To brave Ulysses, that no force of ours<br></span>
<span class="i0">Can bend his bow, we are for ever shamed.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Antinoüs, thus, Eupithes’ son.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not so; (as even thou art well-assured<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thyself, Eurymachus!) but Phœbus claims<br></span>
<span class="i0">This day his own. Who then, on such a day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Would strive to bend it? Let it rather rest.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And should we leave the rings where now they stand,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I trust that none ent’ring Ulysses’ house <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l310" id="BXXI_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Will dare displace them. Cup-bearer, attend!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Serve all with wine, that, first, libation made,<br></span>
<span class="i0">We may religiously lay down the bow.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Command ye too Melanthius, that he drive<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hither the fairest goats of all his flocks<br></span>
<span class="i0">At dawn of day, that burning first, the thighs<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the ethereal archer, we may make<br></span>
<span class="i0">New trial, and decide, at length, the strife.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake Antinoüs, and his counsel pleased.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The heralds, then, pour’d water on their hands, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l320" id="BXXI_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">While youths crown’d high the goblets which they bore<br></span>
<span class="i0">From right to left, distributing to all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">When each had made libation, and had drunk<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till well sufficed, then, artful to effect<br></span>
<span class="i0">His shrewd designs, Ulysses thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Hear, O ye suitors of the illustrious Queen,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My bosom’s dictates. But I shall entreat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Chiefly Eurymachus and the godlike youth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Antinoüs, whose advice is wisely giv’n.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Tamper no longer with the bow, but leave <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l330" id="BXXI_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The matter with the Gods, who shall decide<br></span>
<span class="i0">The strife to-morrow, fav’ring whom they will.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, grant <i>me</i> the polish’d bow, that I<br></span>
<span class="i0">May trial make among you of my force,<br></span>
<span class="i0">If I retain it still in like degree<br></span>
<span class="i0">As erst, or whether wand’ring and defect<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of nourishment have worn it all away.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, whom they with indignation heard<br></span>
<span class="i0">Extreme, alarm’d lest he should bend the bow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And sternly thus Antinoüs replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l340" id="BXXI_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Desperate vagabond! ah wretch deprived<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of reason utterly! art not content?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Esteem’st it not distinction proud enough<br></span>
<span class="i0">To feast with us the nobles of the land?<br></span>
<span class="i0">None robs thee of thy share, thou witnessest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our whole discourse, which, save thyself alone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">No needy vagrant is allow’d to hear.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art befool’d by wine, as many have been,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wide-throated drinkers, unrestrain’d by rule.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wine in the mansion of the mighty Chief <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l350" id="BXXI_l350"></a>350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Pirithoüs, made the valiant Centaur mad<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eurytion, at the Lapithæan feast.<a name="fnm_101" id="fnm_101"></a><a href="#fn_101" class="fnnum">101</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">He drank to drunkenness, and being drunk,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Committed great enormities beneath<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pirithoüs’ roof, and such as fill’d with rage<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Hero-guests; who therefore by his feet<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dragg’d him right through the vestibule, amerced<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of nose and ears, and he departed thence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Provoked to frenzy by that foul disgrace,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whence war between the human kind arose <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l360" id="BXXI_l360"></a>360</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And the bold Centaurs—but he first incurred<br></span>
<span class="i0">By his ebriety that mulct severe.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Great evil, also, if thou bend the bow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To thee I prophesy; for thou shalt find<br></span>
<span class="i0">Advocate or protector none in all<br></span>
<span class="i0">This people, but we will dispatch thee hence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Incontinent on board a sable bark<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Echetus, the scourge of human kind,<br></span>
<span class="i0">From whom is no escape. Drink then in peace,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And contest shun with younger men than thou. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l370" id="BXXI_l370"></a>370</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d, then, Penelope discrete.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Antinoüs! neither seemly were the deed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor just, to maim or harm whatever guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom here arrived Telemachus receives.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Canst thou expect, that should he even prove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stronger than ye, and bend the massy bow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He will conduct me hence to his own home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And make me his own bride? No such design<br></span>
<span class="i0">His heart conceives, or hope; nor let a dread<br></span>
<span class="i0">So vain the mind of any overcloud <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l380" id="BXXI_l380"></a>380</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Who banquets here, since it dishonours me.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So she; to whom Eurymachus reply’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Offspring of Polybus. O matchless Queen!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Icarius’ prudent daughter! none suspects<br></span>
<span class="i0">That thou wilt wed with him; a mate so mean<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should ill become thee; but we fear the tongues<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of either sex, lest some Achaian say<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hereafter, (one inferior far to us)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! how unworthy are they to compare<br></span>
<span class="i0">With him whose wife they seek! to bend his bow <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l390" id="BXXI_l390"></a>390</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Pass’d all their pow’r, yet this poor vagabond,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arriving from what country none can tell,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bent it with ease, and shot through all the rings.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So will they speak, and so shall we be shamed.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer, thus, Penelope return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">No fair report, Eurymachus, attends<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their names or can, who, riotous as ye,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The house dishonour, and consume the wealth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of such a Chief. Why shame ye thus <i>yourselves</i>?<br></span>
<span class="i0">The guest is of athletic frame, well form’d, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l400" id="BXXI_l400"></a>400</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And large of limb; he boasts him also sprung<br></span>
<span class="i0">From noble ancestry. Come then—consent—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Give him the bow, that we may see the proof;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For thus I say, and thus will I perform;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sure as he bends it, and Apollo gives<br></span>
<span class="i0">To him that glory, tunic fair and cloak<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall be his meed from me, a javelin keen<br></span>
<span class="i0">To guard him against men and dogs, a sword<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of double edge, and sandals for his feet,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I will send him whither most he would. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l410" id="BXXI_l410"></a>410</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Her answer’d then prudent Telemachus.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mother—the bow is mine; and, save myself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">No Greek hath right to give it, or refuse.<br></span>
<span class="i0">None who in rock-bound Ithaca possess<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dominion, none in the steed-pastured isles<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Elis, if I chose to make the bow<br></span>
<span class="i0">His own for ever, should that choice controul.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But thou into the house repairing, ply<br></span>
<span class="i0">Spindle and loom, thy province, and enjoin<br></span>
<span class="i0">Diligence to thy maidens; for the bow <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l420" id="BXXI_l420"></a>420</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Is man’s concern alone, and shall be mine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Especially, since I am master here.<br></span>
<span class="i1">She heard astonish’d, and the prudent speech<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reposing of her son deep in her heart,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Withdrew; then mounting with her female train<br></span>
<span class="i0">To her superior chamber, there she wept<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her lost Ulysses, till Minerva bathed<br></span>
<span class="i0">With balmy dews of sleep her weary lids.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now the noble swine-herd bore the bow<br></span>
<span class="i0">Toward Ulysses, but with one voice all <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l430" id="BXXI_l430"></a>430</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors, clamorous, reproved the deed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of whom a youth, thus, insolent exclaim’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thou clumsy swine-herd, whither bear’st the bow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Delirious wretch? the hounds that thou hast train’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall eat thee at thy solitary home<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long, let but Apollo prove, at last,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Propitious to us, and the Pow’rs of heav’n.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So they, whom hearing he replaced the bow<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where erst it stood, terrified at the sound<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of such loud menaces; on the other side <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l440" id="BXXI_l440"></a>440</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus as loud assail’d his ear.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Friend! forward with the bow; or soon repent<br></span>
<span class="i0">That thou obey’dst the many. I will else<br></span>
<span class="i0">With huge stones drive thee, younger as I am,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Back to the field. My strength surpasses thine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I would to heav’n that I in force excell’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">As far, and prowess, every suitor here!<br></span>
<span class="i0">So would I soon give rude dismission hence<br></span>
<span class="i0">To some, who live but to imagine harm.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceased, whose words the suitors laughing heard. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l450" id="BXXI_l450"></a>450</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And, for their sake, in part their wrath resign’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Against Telemachus; then through the hall<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eumæus bore, and to Ulysses’ hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Consign’d the bow; next, summoning abroad<br></span>
<span class="i0">The ancient nurse, he gave her thus in charge.<br></span>
<span class="i1">It is the pleasure of Telemachus,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sage Euryclea! that thou key secure<br></span>
<span class="i0">The doors; and should you hear, perchance, a groan<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or other noise made by the Princes shut<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within the hall, let none look, curious, forth, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l460" id="BXXI_l460"></a>460</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But each in quietness pursue her work.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So he; nor flew his words useless away,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But she, incontinent, shut fast the doors.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, noiseless, sprang Philœtius forth, who closed<br></span>
<span class="i0">The portals also of the palace-court.<br></span>
<span class="i0">A ship-rope of Ægyptian reed, it chanced,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lay in the vestibule; with that he braced<br></span>
<span class="i0">The doors securely, and re-entring fill’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Again his seat, but watchful, eyed his Lord.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He, now, assaying with his hand the bow, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l470" id="BXXI_l470"></a>470</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Made curious trial of it ev’ry way,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And turn’d it on all sides, lest haply worms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had in its master’s absence drill’d the horn.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus a suitor to his next remark’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He hath an eye, methinks, exactly skill’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">In bows, and steals them; or perhaps, at home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath such himself, or feels a strong desire<br></span>
<span class="i0">To make them; so inquisitive the rogue<br></span>
<span class="i0">Adept in mischief, shifts it to and fro!<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom another, insolent, replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l480" id="BXXI_l480"></a>480</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I wish him like prosperity in all<br></span>
<span class="i0">His efforts, as attends his effort made<br></span>
<span class="i0">On this same bow, which he shall never bend.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So they; but when the wary Hero wise<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had made his hand familiar with the bow<br></span>
<span class="i0">Poising it and examining—at once—<br></span>
<span class="i0">As when in harp and song adept, a bard<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unlab’ring strains the chord to a new lyre,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The twisted entrails of a sheep below<br></span>
<span class="i0">With fingers nice inserting, and above, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l490" id="BXXI_l490"></a>490</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With such facility Ulysses bent<br></span>
<span class="i0">His own huge bow, and with his right hand play’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The nerve, which in its quick vibration sang<br></span>
<span class="i0">Clear as the swallow’s voice. Keen anguish seized<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors, wan grew ev’ry cheek, and Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gave him his rolling thunder for a sign.<br></span>
<span class="i0">That omen, granted to him by the son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of wily Saturn, with delight he heard.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He took a shaft that at the table-side<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lay ready drawn; but in his quiver’s womb <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l500" id="BXXI_l500"></a>500</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The rest yet slept, by those Achaians proud<br></span>
<span class="i0">To be, ere long, experienced. True he lodg’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The arrow on the centre of the bow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, occupying still his seat, drew home<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nerve and notch’d arrow-head; with stedfast sight<br></span>
<span class="i0">He aimed and sent it; right through all the rings<br></span>
<span class="i0">From first to last the steel-charged weapon flew<br></span>
<span class="i0">Issuing beyond, and to his son he spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thou need’st not blush, young Prince, to have received<br></span>
<span class="i0">A guest like me; neither my arrow swerved, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l510" id="BXXI_l510"></a>510</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor labour’d I long time to draw the bow;<br></span>
<span class="i0">My strength is unimpair’d, not such as these<br></span>
<span class="i0">In scorn affirm it. But the waning day<br></span>
<span class="i0">Calls us to supper, after which succeeds<a name="fnm_102" id="fnm_102"></a><a href="#fn_102" class="fnnum">102</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">Jocund variety, the song, the harp,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With all that heightens and adorns the feast.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and with his brows gave him the sign.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At once the son of the illustrious Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slung his keen faulchion, grasp’d his spear, and stood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arm’d bright for battle at his father’s side. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXI_l520" id="BXXI_l520"></a>520</span><br></span>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">Ulysses, with some little assistance from Telemachus, Eumæus and
Philœtius, slays all the suitors, and twelve of the female servants
who had allowed themselves an illicit intercourse with them, are hanged.
Melanthius also is punished with miserable mutilation.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, girding up his rags, Ulysses sprang<br></span>
<span class="i0">With bow and full-charged quiver to the door;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Loose on the broad stone at his feet he pour’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">His arrows, and the suitors, thus, bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">This prize, though difficult, hath been atchieved.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now for another mark which never man<br></span>
<span class="i0">Struck yet, but I will strike it if I may,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And if Apollo make that glory mine.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and at Antinoüs aimed direct<br></span>
<span class="i0">A bitter shaft; he, purposing to drink, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l10" id="BXXII_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Both hands advanced toward the golden cup<br></span>
<span class="i0">Twin-ear’d, nor aught suspected death so nigh.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For who, at the full banquet, could suspect<br></span>
<span class="i0">That any single guest, however brave,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should plan his death, and execute the blow?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet him Ulysses with an arrow pierced<br></span>
<span class="i0">Full in the throat, and through his neck behind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Started the glitt’ring point. Aslant he droop’d;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Down fell the goblet, through his nostrils flew<br></span>
<span class="i0">The spouted blood, and spurning with his foot <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l20" id="BXXII_l20"></a>20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The board, he spread his viands in the dust.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Confusion, when they saw Antinoüs fall’n,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seized all the suitors; from the thrones they sprang,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Flew ev’ry way, and on all sides explored<br></span>
<span class="i0">The palace-walls, but neither sturdy lance<br></span>
<span class="i0">As erst, nor buckler could they there discern,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, furious, to Ulysses thus they spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thy arrow, stranger, was ill-aimed; a man<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is no just mark. Thou never shalt dispute<br></span>
<span class="i0">Prize more. Inevitable death is thine. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l30" id="BXXII_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">For thou hast slain a Prince noblest of all<br></span>
<span class="i0">In Ithaca, and shalt be vultures’ food.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Various their judgments were, but none believed<br></span>
<span class="i0">That he had slain him wittingly, nor saw<br></span>
<span class="i0">Th’ infatuate men fate hov’ring o’er them all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus Ulysses, louring dark, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">O dogs! not fearing aught my safe return<br></span>
<span class="i0">From Ilium, ye have shorn my substance close,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lain with my women forcibly, and sought,<br></span>
<span class="i0">While yet I lived, to make my consort yours, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l40" id="BXXII_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Heedless of the inhabitants of heav’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alike, and of the just revenge of man.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But death is on the wing; death for you all.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said; their cheeks all faded at the sound,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And each with sharpen’d eyes search’d ev’ry nook<br></span>
<span class="i0">For an escape from his impending doom,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till thus, alone, Eurymachus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">If thou indeed art he, the mighty Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ithaca return’d, thou hast rehears’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With truth the crimes committed by the Greeks <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l50" id="BXXII_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Frequent, both in thy house and in thy field.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But he, already, who was cause of all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lies slain, Antinoüs; he thy palace fill’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With outrage, not solicitous so much<br></span>
<span class="i0">To win the fair Penelope, but thoughts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Far diff’rent framing, which Saturnian Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath baffled all; to rule, himself, supreme<br></span>
<span class="i0">In noble Ithaca, when he had kill’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">By an insidious stratagem thy son.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But he is slain. Now therefore, spare thy own, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l60" id="BXXII_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy people; public reparation due<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall sure be thine, and to appease thy wrath<br></span>
<span class="i0">For all the waste that, eating, drinking here<br></span>
<span class="i0">We have committed, we will yield thee, each,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Full twenty beeves, gold paying thee beside<br></span>
<span class="i0">And brass, till joy shall fill thee at the sight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">However just thine anger was before.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, frowning stern, replied,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eurymachus, would ye contribute each<br></span>
<span class="i0">His whole inheritance, and other sums <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l70" id="BXXII_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Still add beside, ye should not, even so,<br></span>
<span class="i0">These hands of mine bribe to abstain from blood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till ev’ry suitor suffer for his wrong.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ye have your choice. Fight with me, or escape<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Whoever may) the terrours of his fate,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But ye all perish, if my thought be true.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, they with trembling knees and hearts<br></span>
<span class="i0">All heard, whom thus Eurymachus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To your defence, my friends! for respite none<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will he to his victorious hands afford, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l80" id="BXXII_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But, arm’d with bow and quiver, will dispatch<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shafts from the door till he have slain us all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore to arms—draw each his sword—oppose<br></span>
<span class="i0">The tables to his shafts, and all at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rush on him; that, dislodging him at least<br></span>
<span class="i0">From portal and from threshold, we may give<br></span>
<span class="i0">The city on all sides a loud alarm,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So shall this archer soon have shot his last.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus saying, he drew his brazen faulchion keen<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of double edge, and with a dreadful cry <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l90" id="BXXII_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Sprang on him; but Ulysses with a shaft<br></span>
<span class="i0">In that same moment through his bosom driv’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">Transfix’d his liver, and down dropp’d his sword.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He, staggering around his table, fell<br></span>
<span class="i0">Convolv’d in agonies, and overturn’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both food and wine; his forehead smote the floor;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Woe fill’d his heart, and spurning with his heels<br></span>
<span class="i0">His vacant seat, he shook it till he died.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, with his faulchion drawn, Amphinomus<br></span>
<span class="i0">Advanced to drive Ulysses from the door, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l100" id="BXXII_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And fierce was his assault; but, from behind,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus between his shoulders fix’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">A brazen lance, and urged it through his breast.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Full on his front, with hideous sound, he fell.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving the weapon planted in his spine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Back flew Telemachus, lest, had he stood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Drawing it forth, some enemy, perchance,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should either pierce him with a sudden thrust<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oblique, or hew him with a downright edge.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Swift, therefore, to his father’s side he ran, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l110" id="BXXII_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom reaching, in wing’d accents thus he said.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My father! I will now bring thee a shield,<br></span>
<span class="i0">An helmet, and two spears; I will enclose<br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself in armour also, and will give<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both to the herdsmen and Eumæus arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Expedient now, and needful for us all.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Run; fetch them, while I yet have arrows left,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lest, single, I be justled from the door.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and, at his word, forth went the Prince, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l120" id="BXXII_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Seeking the chamber where he had secured<br></span>
<span class="i0">The armour. Thence he took four shields, eight spears,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With four hair-crested helmets, charged with which<br></span>
<span class="i0">He hasted to his father’s side again,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, arming first himself, furnish’d with arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">His two attendants. Then, all clad alike<br></span>
<span class="i0">In splendid brass, beside the dauntless Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, his auxiliars firm they stood.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He, while a single arrow unemploy’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lay at his foot, right-aiming, ever pierced <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l130" id="BXXII_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Some suitor through, and heaps on heaps they fell.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when his arrows fail’d the royal Chief,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His bow reclining at the portal’s side<br></span>
<span class="i0">Against the palace-wall, he slung, himself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A four-fold buckler on his arm, he fix’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">A casque whose crest wav’d awful o’er his brows<br></span>
<span class="i0">On his illustrious head, and fill’d his gripe<br></span>
<span class="i0">With two stout spears, well-headed both, with brass.<br></span>
<span class="i1">There was a certain postern in the wall<a name="fnm_103" id="fnm_103"></a><a href="#fn_103" class="fnnum">103</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">At the gate-side, the customary pass <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l140" id="BXXII_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Into a narrow street, but barr’d secure.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses bade his faithful swine-herd watch<br></span>
<span class="i0">That egress, station’d near it, for it own’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">One sole approach; then Agelaüs loud<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exhorting all the suitors, thus exclaim’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Oh friends, will none, ascending to the door<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of yonder postern, summon to our aid<br></span>
<span class="i0">The populace, and spread a wide alarm?<br></span>
<span class="i0">So shall this archer soon have shot his last.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom the keeper of the goats replied <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l150" id="BXXII_l150"></a>150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Melanthius. Agelaüs! Prince renown’d!<br></span>
<span class="i0">That may not be. The postern and the gate<a name="fnm_104" id="fnm_104"></a><a href="#fn_104" class="fnnum">104</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">Neighbour too near each other, and to force<br></span>
<span class="i0">The narrow egress were a vain attempt;<br></span>
<span class="i0">One valiant man might thence repulse us all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But come—myself will furnish you with arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fetch’d from above; for there, as I suppose,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(And not elsewhere) Ulysses and his son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have hidden them, and there they shall be found.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake Melanthius, and, ascending, sought <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l160" id="BXXII_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses’ chambers through the winding stairs<br></span>
<span class="i0">And gall’ries of the house. Twelve bucklers thence<br></span>
<span class="i0">He took, as many spears, and helmets bright<br></span>
<span class="i0">As many, shagg’d with hair, then swift return’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">And gave them to his friends. Trembled the heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of brave Ulysses, and his knees, at sight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of his opposers putting armour on,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And shaking each his spear; arduous indeed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now seem’d his task, and in wing’d accents brief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus to his son Telemachus he spake. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l170" id="BXXII_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Either some woman of our train contrives<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hard battle for us, furnishing with arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors, or Melanthius arms them all.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d then Telemachus discrete.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Father, this fault was mine, and be it charged<br></span>
<span class="i0">On none beside; I left the chamber-door<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unbarr’d, which, more attentive than myself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their spy perceived. But haste, Eumæus, shut<br></span>
<span class="i0">The chamber-door, observing well, the while,<br></span>
<span class="i0">If any women of our train have done <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l180" id="BXXII_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">This deed, or whether, as I more suspect,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Melanthius, Dolius’ son, have giv’n them arms.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus mutual they conferr’d; meantime, again<br></span>
<span class="i0">Melanthius to the chamber flew in quest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of other arms. Eumæus, as he went,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mark’d him, and to Ulysses’ thus he spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Laertes’ noble son, for wiles renown’d!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, the traytor, whom ourselves supposed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seeks yet again the chamber! Tell me plain,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I, should I superior prove in force, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l190" id="BXXII_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Slay him, or shall I drag him thence to thee,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That he may suffer at thy hands the doom<br></span>
<span class="i0">Due to his treasons perpetrated oft<br></span>
<span class="i0">Against thee, here, even in thy own house?<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer thus Ulysses shrewd return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I, with Telemachus, will here immew<br></span>
<span class="i0">The lordly suitors close, rage as they may.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ye two, the while, bind fast Melanthius’ hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">And feet behind his back, then cast him bound<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into the chamber, and (the door secured) <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l200" id="BXXII_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Pass underneath his arms a double chain,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And by a pillar’s top weigh him aloft<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till he approach the rafters, there to endure,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Living long time, the mis’ries he hath earned.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake; they prompt obey’d; together both<br></span>
<span class="i0">They sought the chamber, whom the wretch within<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heard not, exploring ev’ry nook for arms.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They watching stood the door, from which, at length,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forth came Melanthius, bearing in one hand<br></span>
<span class="i0">A casque, and in the other a broad shield <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l210" id="BXXII_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Time-worn and chapp’d with drought, which in his youth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Warlike Laertes had been wont to bear.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Long time neglected it had lain, till age<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had loosed the sutures of its bands. At once<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both, springing on him, seized and drew him in<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forcibly by his locks, then cast him down<br></span>
<span class="i0">Prone on the pavement, trembling at his fate.<br></span>
<span class="i0">With painful stricture of the cord his hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">They bound and feet together at his back,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As their illustrious master had enjoined, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l220" id="BXXII_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then weigh’d him with a double chain aloft<br></span>
<span class="i0">By a tall pillar to the palace-roof,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thus, deriding him, Eumæus spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Now, good Melanthius, on that fleecy bed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reclined, as well befits thee, thou wilt watch<br></span>
<span class="i0">All night, nor when the golden dawn forsakes<br></span>
<span class="i0">The ocean stream, will she escape thine eye,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But thou wilt duly to the palace drive<br></span>
<span class="i0">The fattest goats, a banquet for thy friends.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he left him in his dreadful sling. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l230" id="BXXII_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, arming both, and barring fast the door,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They sought brave Laertiades again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now, courageous at the portal stood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Those four, by numbers in the interior house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Opposed of adversaries fierce in arms,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When Pallas, in the form and with the voice<br></span>
<span class="i0">Approach’d of Mentor, whom Laertes’ son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld, and joyful at the sight, exclaim’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Help, Mentor! help—now recollect a friend<br></span>
<span class="i0">And benefactor, born when thou wast born. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l240" id="BXXII_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">So he, not unsuspicious that he saw<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pallas, the heroine of heav’n. Meantime<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors fill’d with menaces the dome,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Agelaüs, first, Damastor’s son,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In accents harsh rebuked the Goddess thus.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Beware, oh Mentor! that he lure thee not<br></span>
<span class="i0">To oppose the suitors and to aid himself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For thus will we. Ulysses and his son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both slain, in vengeance of thy purpos’d deeds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Against us, we will slay <i>thee</i> next, and thou <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l250" id="BXXII_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With thy own head shalt satisfy the wrong.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Your force thus quell’d in battle, all thy wealth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whether in house or field, mingled with his,<br></span>
<span class="i0">We will confiscate, neither will we leave<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or son of thine, or daughter in thy house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alive, nor shall thy virtuous consort more<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within the walls of Ithaca be seen.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, and his words with wrath inflamed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Minerva’s heart the more; incensed, she turn’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Towards Ulysses, whom she thus reproved. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l260" id="BXXII_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Thou neither own’st the courage nor the force,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, now, which nine whole years thou showd’st<br></span>
<span class="i0">At Ilium, waging battle obstinate<br></span>
<span class="i0">For high-born Helen, and in horrid fight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Destroying multitudes, till thy advice<br></span>
<span class="i0">At last lay’d Priam’s bulwark’d city low.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Why, in possession of thy proper home<br></span>
<span class="i0">And substance, mourn’st thou want of pow’r t’oppose<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors? Stand beside me, mark my deeds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thou shalt own Mentor Alcimides <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l270" id="BXXII_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A valiant friend, and mindful of thy love.<br></span>
<span class="i1">She spake; nor made she victory as yet<br></span>
<span class="i0">Entire his own, proving the valour, first,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both of the sire and of his glorious son,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, springing in a swallow’s form aloft,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Perch’d on a rafter of the splendid roof.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, Agelaüs animated loud<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors, whom Eurynomus also roused,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amphimedon, and Demoptolemus,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Polyctorides, Pisander named, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l280" id="BXXII_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And Polybus the brave; for noblest far<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the suitor-chiefs who now survived<br></span>
<span class="i0">And fought for life were these. The bow had quell’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">And shafts, in quick succession sent, the rest.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then Agelaüs, thus, harangued them all.<br></span>
<span class="i1">We soon shall tame, O friends, this warrior’s might,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Mentor, after all his airy vaunts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath left, and at the portal now remain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Themselves alone. Dismiss not therefore, all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Your spears together, but with six alone <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l290" id="BXXII_l290"></a>290</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Assail them first; Jove willing, we shall pierce<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, and subduing him, shall slay<br></span>
<span class="i0">With ease the rest; their force is safely scorn’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceas’d; and, as he bade, six hurl’d the spear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Together; but Minerva gave them all<br></span>
<span class="i0">A devious flight; one struck a column, one<br></span>
<span class="i0">The planks of the broad portal, and a third<a name="fnm_105" id="fnm_105"></a><a href="#fn_105" class="fnnum">105</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">Flung right his ashen beam pond’rous with brass<br></span>
<span class="i0">Against the wall. Then (ev’ry suitor’s spear<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eluded) thus Ulysses gave the word— <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l300" id="BXXII_l300"></a>300</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Now friends! I counsel you that ye dismiss<br></span>
<span class="i0">Your spears at <i>them</i>, who, not content with past<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enormities, thirst also for our blood.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and with unerring aim, all threw<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their glitt’ring spears. Ulysses on the ground<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stretch’d Demoptolemus; Euryades<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fell by Telemachus; the swine-herd slew<br></span>
<span class="i0">El[)a]tus; and the keeper of the beeves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pisander; in one moment all alike<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lay grinding with their teeth the dusty floor. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l310" id="BXXII_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Back flew the suitors to the farthest wall,<br></span>
<span class="i0">On whom those valiant four advancing, each<br></span>
<span class="i0">Recover’d, quick, his weapon from the dead.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then hurl’d the desp’rate suitors yet again<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their glitt’ring spears, but Pallas gave to each<br></span>
<span class="i0">A frustrate course; one struck a column, one<br></span>
<span class="i0">The planks of the broad portal, and a third<br></span>
<span class="i0">Flung full his ashen beam against the wall.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet pierced Amphimedon the Prince’s wrist,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But slightly, a skin-wound, and o’er his shield <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l320" id="BXXII_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ctesippus reach’d the shoulder of the good<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eumæus, but his glancing weapon swift<br></span>
<span class="i0">O’erflew the mark, and fell. And now the four,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, dauntless Hero, and his friends<br></span>
<span class="i0">All hurl’d their spears together in return,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself Ulysses, city-waster Chief,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wounded Eurydamas; Ulysses’ son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amphimedon; the swine-herd Polybus;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in his breast the keeper of the beeves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ctesippus, glorying over whom, he cried. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l330" id="BXXII_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Oh son of Polytherses! whose delight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath been to taunt and jeer, never again<br></span>
<span class="i0">Boast foolishly, but to the Gods commit<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy tongue, since they are mightier far than thou.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Take this—a compensation for thy pledge<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of hospitality, the huge ox-hoof,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which while he roam’d the palace, begging alms,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses at thy bounteous hand received.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So gloried he; then, grasping still his spear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses pierced Damastor’s son, and, next, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l340" id="BXXII_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus, enforcing his long beam<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sheer through his bowels and his back, transpierced<br></span>
<span class="i0">Leiocritus, he prostrate smote the floor.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, Pallas from the lofty roof held forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her host-confounding Ægis o’er their heads,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With’ring their souls with fear. They through the hall<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fled, scatter’d as an herd, which rapid-wing’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The gad-fly dissipates, infester fell<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of beeves, when vernal suns shine hot and long.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, as when bow-beak’d vultures crooked-claw’d<a name="fnm_106" id="fnm_106"></a><a href="#fn_106" class="fnnum">106</a> <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l350" id="BXXII_l350"></a>350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Stoop from the mountains on the smaller fowl;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Terrified at the toils that spread the plain<br></span>
<span class="i0">The flocks take wing, they, darting from above,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Strike, seize, and slay, resistance or escape<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is none, the fowler’s heart leaps with delight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So they, pursuing through the spacious hall<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors, smote them on all sides, their heads<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sounded beneath the sword, with hideous groans<br></span>
<span class="i0">The palace rang, and the floor foamed with blood.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then flew Leiodes to Ulysses’ knees, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l360" id="BXXII_l360"></a>360</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Which clasping, in wing’d accents thus he cried.<br></span>

<span class="i1">I clasp thy knees, Ulysses! oh respect<br></span>
<span class="i0">My suit, and spare me! Never have I word<br></span>
<span class="i0">Injurious spoken, or injurious deed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attempted ’gainst the women of thy house,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But others, so transgressing, oft forbad.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet they abstain’d not, and a dreadful fate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Due to their wickedness have, therefore, found.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But I, their soothsayer alone, must fall,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Though unoffending; such is the return <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l370" id="BXXII_l370"></a>370</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">By mortals made for benefits received!<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, louring dark, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is that thy boast? Hast thou indeed for these<br></span>
<span class="i0">The seer’s high office fill’d? Then, doubtless, oft<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy pray’r hath been that distant far might prove<br></span>
<span class="i0">The day delectable of my return,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And that my consort might thy own become<br></span>
<span class="i0">To bear thee children; wherefore thee I doom<br></span>
<span class="i0">To a dire death which thou shalt not avoid.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he caught the faulchion from the floor <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l380" id="BXXII_l380"></a>380</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Which Agelaüs had let fall, and smote<br></span>
<span class="i0">Leiodes, while he kneel’d, athwart his neck<br></span>
<span class="i0">So suddenly, that ere his tongue had ceased<br></span>
<span class="i0">To plead for life, his head was in the dust.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But Phemius, son of Terpius, bard divine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, through compulsion, with his song regaled<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors, a like dreadful death escaped.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fast by the postern, harp in hand, he stood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Doubtful if, issuing, he should take his seat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the altar of Hercæan Jove,<a name="fnm_107" id="fnm_107"></a><a href="#fn_107" class="fnnum">107</a> <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l390" id="BXXII_l390"></a>390</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Where oft Ulysses offer’d, and his sire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fat thighs of beeves, or whether he should haste,<br></span>
<span class="i0">An earnest suppliant, to embrace his knees.<br></span>
<span class="i0">That course, at length, most pleased him; then, between<br></span>
<span class="i0">The beaker and an argent-studded throne<br></span>
<span class="i0">He grounded his sweet lyre, and seizing fast<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Hero’s knees, him, suppliant, thus address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">I clasp thy knees, Ulysses! oh respect<br></span>
<span class="i0">My suit, and spare me. Thou shalt not escape<br></span>
<span class="i0">Regret thyself hereafter, if thou slay <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l400" id="BXXII_l400"></a>400</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Me, charmer of the woes of Gods and men.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Self-taught am I, and treasure in my mind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Themes of all argument from heav’n inspired,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I can sing to thee as to a God.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, then, behead me not. Put ev’n the wish<br></span>
<span class="i0">Far from thee! for thy own beloved son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Can witness, that not drawn by choice, or driv’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">By stress of want, resorting to thine house<br></span>
<span class="i0">I have regaled these revellers so oft,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But under force of mightier far than I. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l410" id="BXXII_l410"></a>410</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">So he; whose words soon as the sacred might<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heard of Telemachus, approaching quick<br></span>
<span class="i0">His father, thus, humane, he interposed.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Hold, harm not with the vengeful faulchion’s edge<br></span>
<span class="i0">This blameless man; and we will also spare<br></span>
<span class="i0">Medon the herald, who hath ever been<br></span>
<span class="i0">A watchful guardian of my boyish years,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unless Philœtius have already slain him,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or else Eumæus, or thyself, perchance,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unconscious, in the tumult of our foes. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l420" id="BXXII_l420"></a>420</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake, whom Medon hearing (for he lay<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath a throne, and in a new-stript hide<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enfolded, trembling with the dread of death)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sprang from his hiding-place, and casting off<br></span>
<span class="i0">The skin, flew to Telemachus, embraced<br></span>
<span class="i0">His knees, and in wing’d accents thus exclaim’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Prince! I am here—oh, pity me! repress<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thine own, and pacify thy father’s wrath,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That he destroy not me, through fierce revenge<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of their iniquities who have consumed <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l430" id="BXXII_l430"></a>430</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His wealth, and, in their folly scorn’d his son.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Smiling complacent. Fear not; my own son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath pleaded for thee. Therefore (taught thyself<br></span>
<span class="i0">That truth) teach others the superior worth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of benefits with injuries compared.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But go ye forth, thou and the sacred bard,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That ye may sit distant in yonder court<br></span>
<span class="i0">From all this carnage, while I give command,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself, concerning it, to those within. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l440" id="BXXII_l440"></a>440</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceas’d; they going forth, took each his seat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside Jove’s altar, but with careful looks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Suspicious, dreading without cease the sword.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime Ulysses search’d his hall, in quest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of living foes, if any still survived<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unpunish’d; but he found them all alike<br></span>
<span class="i0">Welt’ring in dust and blood; num’rous they lay<br></span>
<span class="i0">Like fishes when they strew the sinuous shore<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ocean, from the grey gulph drawn aground<br></span>
<span class="i0">In nets of many a mesh; they on the sands <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l450" id="BXXII_l450"></a>450</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Lie spread, athirst for the salt wave, till hot<br></span>
<span class="i0">The gazing sun dries all their life away;<br></span>
<span class="i0">So lay the suitors heap’d, and thus at length<br></span>
<span class="i0">The prudent Chief gave order to his son.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Telemachus! bid Euryclea come<br></span>
<span class="i0">Quickly, the nurse, to whom I would impart<br></span>
<span class="i0">The purpose which now occupies me most.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said; obedient to his sire, the Prince<br></span>
<span class="i0">Smote on the door, and summon’d loud the nurse.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Arise thou ancient governess of all <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l460" id="BXXII_l460"></a>460</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Our female menials, and come forth; attend<br></span>
<span class="i0">My father; he hath somewhat for thine ear.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So he; nor flew his words useless away,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For, throwing wide the portal, forth she came,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, by Telemachus conducted, found<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long Ulysses amid all the slain,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With blood defiled and dust; dread he appear’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">As from the pastur’d ox newly-devoured<br></span>
<span class="i0">The lion stalking back; his ample chest<br></span>
<span class="i0">With gory drops and his broad cheeks are hung, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l470" id="BXXII_l470"></a>470</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Tremendous spectacle! such seem’d the Chief,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Blood-stain’d all over. She, the carnage spread<br></span>
<span class="i0">On all sides seeing, and the pools of blood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Felt impulse forcible to publish loud<br></span>
<span class="i0">That wond’rous triumph; but her Lord repress’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The shout of rapture ere it burst abroad,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in wing’d accents thus his will enforced.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Silent exult, O ancient matron dear!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shout not, be still. Unholy is the voice<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of loud thanksgiving over slaughter’d men. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l480" id="BXXII_l480"></a>480</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Their own atrocious deeds and the Gods’ will<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have slain all these; for whether noble guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arrived or base, they scoff’d at all alike,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And for their wickedness have, therefore, died.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But say; of my domestic women, who<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have scorn’d me, and whom find’st thou innocent?<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom good Euryclea thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My son! I will declare the truth; thou keep’st<br></span>
<span class="i0">Female domestics fifty in thy house,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom we have made intelligent to comb <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l490" id="BXXII_l490"></a>490</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The fleece, and to perform whatever task.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of these, twice six have overpass’d the bounds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of modesty, respecting neither me,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet the Queen; and thy own son, adult<br></span>
<span class="i0">So lately, no permission had from her<br></span>
<span class="i0">To regulate the women of her train.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But I am gone, I fly with what hath pass’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the Queen’s ear, who nought suspects, so sound<br></span>
<span class="i0">She sleeps, by some divinity composed.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer, thus, Ulysses wise returned. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l500" id="BXXII_l500"></a>500</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Hush, and disturb her not. Go. Summon first<br></span>
<span class="i0">Those wantons, who have long deserved to die.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceas’d; then issued forth the ancient dame<br></span>
<span class="i0">To summon those bad women, and, meantime,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Calling his son, Philœtius, and Eumæus,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses in wing’d accents thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Bestir ye, and remove the dead; command<br></span>
<span class="i0">Those women also to your help; then cleanse<br></span>
<span class="i0">With bibulous sponges and with water all<br></span>
<span class="i0">The seats and tables; when ye shall have thus <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l510" id="BXXII_l510"></a>510</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Set all in order, lead those women forth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in the centre of the spacious court,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Between the scull’ry and the outer-wall<br></span>
<span class="i0">Smite them with your broad faulchions till they lose<br></span>
<span class="i0">In death the mem’ry of their secret loves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Indulged with wretches lawless as themselves.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, and the damsels came at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">All forth, lamenting, and with tepid tears<br></span>
<span class="i0">Show’ring the ground; with mutual labour, first,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing the bodies forth into the court, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l520" id="BXXII_l520"></a>520</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">They lodged them in the portico; meantime<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, stern, enjoin’d them haste, and, urged<br></span>
<span class="i0">By sad necessity, they bore all out.<br></span>
<span class="i0">With sponges and with water, next, they cleansed<br></span>
<span class="i0">The thrones and tables, while Telemachus<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beesom’d the floor, Eumæus in that work<br></span>
<span class="i0">Aiding him and the keeper of the beeves,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And those twelve damsels bearing forth the soil.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, order giv’n to all within, they, next,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Led forth the women, whom they shut between <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l530" id="BXXII_l530"></a>530</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The scull’ry and the outer-wall in close<br></span>
<span class="i0">Durance, from which no pris’ner could escape,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thus Telemachus discrete began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">An honourable death is not for these<br></span>
<span class="i0">By my advice, who have so often heap’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reproach on mine and on my mother’s head,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And held lewd commerce with the suitor-train.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and noosing a strong galley-rope<br></span>
<span class="i0">To an huge column, led the cord around<br></span>
<span class="i0">The spacious dome, suspended so aloft <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l540" id="BXXII_l540"></a>540</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That none with quiv’ring feet might reach the floor.<br></span>
<span class="i0">As when a flight of doves ent’ring the copse,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or broad-wing’d thrushes, strike against the net<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within, ill rest, entangled, there they find,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So they, suspended by the neck, expired<br></span>
<span class="i0">All in one line together. Death abhorr’d!<br></span>
<span class="i0">With restless feet awhile they beat the air,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then ceas’d. And now through vestibule and hall<br></span>
<span class="i0">They led Melanthius forth. With ruthless steel<br></span>
<span class="i0">They pared away his ears and nose, pluck’d forth <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l550" id="BXXII_l550"></a>550</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His parts of shame, destin’d to feed the dogs,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, still indignant, lopp’d his hands and feet.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, laving each his feet and hands, they sought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Again Ulysses; all their work was done,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thus the Chief to Euryclea spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Bring blast-averting sulphur, nurse, bring fire!<br></span>
<span class="i0">That I may fumigate my walls; then bid<br></span>
<span class="i0">Penelope with her attendants down,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And summon all the women of her train.<br></span>
<span class="i1">But Euryclea, thus, his nurse, replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l560" id="BXXII_l560"></a>560</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">My son! thou hast well said; yet will I first<br></span>
<span class="i0">Serve thee with vest and mantle. Stand not here<br></span>
<span class="i0">In thy own palace cloath’d with tatters foul<br></span>
<span class="i0">And beggarly—she will abhor the sight.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer thus Ulysses wise return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not so. Bring fire for fumigation first.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said; nor Euryclea his lov’d nurse<br></span>
<span class="i0">Longer delay’d, but sulphur brought and fire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When he with purifying steams, himself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Visited ev’ry part, the banquet-room, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l570" id="BXXII_l570"></a>570</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The vestibule, the court. Ranging meantime<br></span>
<span class="i0">His house magnificent, the matron call’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The women to attend their Lord in haste,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And they attended, bearing each a torch.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then gather’d they around him all, sincere<br></span>
<span class="i0">Welcoming his return; with close embrace<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enfolding him, each kiss’d his brows, and each<br></span>
<span class="i0">His shoulders, and his hands lock’d fast in hers.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He, irresistible the impulse felt<br></span>
<span class="i0">To sigh and weep, well recognizing all. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXII_l580" id="BXXII_l580"></a>580</span><br></span>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">Ulysses with some difficulty, convinces Penelope of his identity, who at
length, overcome by force of evidence, receives him to her arms with
transport. He entertains her with a recital of his adventures, and in his
narration the principal events of the poem are recapitulated. In the
morning, Ulysses, Telemachus, the herdsman and the swine-herd depart into
the country.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now, with exultation loud the nurse<br></span>
<span class="i0">Again ascended, eager to apprize<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Queen of her Ulysses’ safe return;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Joy braced her knees, with nimbleness of youth<br></span>
<span class="i0">She stepp’d, and at her ear, her thus bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Arise, Penelope! dear daughter, see<br></span>
<span class="i0">With thy own eyes thy daily wish fulfill’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses is arrived; hath reach’d at last<br></span>
<span class="i0">His native home, and all those suitors proud<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath slaughter’d, who his family distress’d, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l10" id="BXXIII_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His substance wasted, and controul’d his son.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Penelope discrete replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dear nurse! the Gods have surely ta’en away<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy judgment; they transform the wise to fools,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And fools conduct to wisdom, and have marr’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy intellect, who wast discrete before.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Why wilt thou mock me, wretched as I am,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With tales extravagant? and why disturb<br></span>
<span class="i0">Those slumbers sweet that seal’d so fast mine eyes?<br></span>
<span class="i0">For such sweet slumbers have I never known <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l20" id="BXXIII_l20"></a>20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Since my Ulysses on his voyage sail’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To that bad city never to be named.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Down instant to thy place again—begone—<br></span>
<span class="i0">For had another of my maidens dared<br></span>
<span class="i0">Disturb my sleep with tidings wild as these,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I had dismiss’d her down into the house<br></span>
<span class="i0">More roughly; but thine age excuses <i>thee</i>.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom the venerable matron thus.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I mock thee not, my child; no—he is come—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself, Ulysses, even as I say, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l30" id="BXXIII_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">That stranger, object of the scorn of all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus well knew his sire arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But prudently conceal’d the tidings, so<br></span>
<span class="i0">To insure the more the suitors’ punishment.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So Euryclea she transported heard,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And springing from the bed, wrapp’d in her arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">The ancient woman shedding tears of joy,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in wing’d accents ardent thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ah then, dear nurse inform me! tell me true!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath he indeed arriv’d as thou declar’st? <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l40" id="BXXIII_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">How dared he to assail alone that band<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of shameless ones, for ever swarming here?<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then Euryclea, thus, matron belov’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I nothing saw or knew; but only heard<br></span>
<span class="i0">Groans of the wounded; in th’ interior house<br></span>
<span class="i0">We trembling sat, and ev’ry door was fast.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus all remain’d till by his father sent,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy own son call’d me forth. Going, I found<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses compass’d by the slaughter’d dead.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They cover’d wide the pavement, heaps on heaps. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l50" id="BXXIII_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">It would have cheer’d thy heart to have beheld<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy husband lion-like with crimson stains<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of slaughter and of dust all dappled o’er;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heap’d in the portal, at this moment, lie<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their bodies, and he fumigates, meantime,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The house with sulphur and with flames of fire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And hath, himself, sent me to bid thee down.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Follow me, then, that ye may give your hearts<br></span>
<span class="i0">To gladness, both, for ye have much endured;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But the event, so long your soul’s desire, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l60" id="BXXIII_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Is come; himself hath to his household Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alive return’d, thee and his son he finds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unharm’d and at your home, nor hath he left<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unpunish’d one of all his enemies.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Her answer’d, then, Penelope discrete.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ah dearest nurse! indulge not to excess<br></span>
<span class="i0">This dang’rous triumph. Thou art well apprized<br></span>
<span class="i0">How welcome his appearance here would prove<br></span>
<span class="i0">To all, but chief, to me, and to his son,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fruit of our love. But these things are not so; <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l70" id="BXXIII_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Some God, resentful of their evil deeds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And of their biting contumely severe,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath slain those proud; for whether noble guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arrived or base, alike they scoff’d at all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And for their wickedness have therefore died.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But my Ulysses distant far, I know,<br></span>
<span class="i0">From Greece hath perish’d, and returns no more.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom thus Euryclea, nurse belov’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">What word my daughter had escaped thy lips,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who thus affirm’st thy husband, now within <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l80" id="BXXIII_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And at his own hearth-side, for ever lost?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Canst thou be thus incredulous? Hear again—<br></span>
<span class="i0">I give thee yet proof past dispute, his scar<br></span>
<span class="i0">Imprinted by a wild-boar’s iv’ry tusk.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laving him I remark’d it, and desired,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Myself, to tell thee, but he, ever-wise,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Compressing with both hands my lips, forbad.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Come, follow me. My life shall be the pledge.<br></span>
<span class="i0">If I deceive thee, kill me as thou wilt.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Penelope, discrete, replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l90" id="BXXIII_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, dearest nurse, sagacious as thou art,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou little know’st to scan the counsels wise<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the eternal Gods. But let us seek<br></span>
<span class="i0">My son, however, that I may behold<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors dead, and him by whom they died.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, she left her chamber, musing much<br></span>
<span class="i0">In her descent, whether to interrogate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her Lord apart, or whether to imprint,<br></span>
<span class="i0">At once, his hands with kisses and his brows.<br></span>
<span class="i0">O’erpassing light the portal-step of stone <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l100" id="BXXIII_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">She enter’d. He sat opposite, illumed<br></span>
<span class="i0">By the hearth’s sprightly blaze, and close before<br></span>
<span class="i0">A pillar of the dome, waiting with eyes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Downcast, till viewing him, his noble spouse<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should speak to him; but she sat silent long,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her faculties in mute amazement held.<br></span>
<span class="i0">By turns she riveted her eyes on his,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, seeing him so foul attired, by turns<br></span>
<span class="i0">She recognized him not; then spake her son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus, and her silence thus reprov’d. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l110" id="BXXIII_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">My mother! ah my hapless and my most<br></span>
<span class="i0">Obdurate mother! wherefore thus aloof<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shunn’st thou my father, neither at his side<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sitting affectionate, nor utt’ring word?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Another wife lives not who could endure<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such distance from her husband new-return’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To his own country in the twentieth year,<br></span>
<span class="i0">After much hardship; but thy heart is still<br></span>
<span class="i0">As ever, less impressible than stone,<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Penelope, discrete, replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l120" id="BXXIII_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I am all wonder, O my son; my soul<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is stunn’d within me; pow’r to speak to him<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or to interrogate him have I none,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or ev’n to look on him; but if indeed<br></span>
<span class="i0">He be Ulysses, and have reach’d his home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I shall believe it soon, by proof convinced<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of signs known only to himself and me.<br></span>
<span class="i1">She said; then smiled the Hero toil-inured,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in wing’d accents thus spake to his son.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Leave thou, Telemachus, thy mother here <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l130" id="BXXIII_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To sift and prove me; she will know me soon<br></span>
<span class="i0">More certainly; she sees me ill-attired<br></span>
<span class="i0">And squalid now; therefore she shews me scorn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And no belief hath yet that I am he.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But we have need, thou and myself, of deep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deliberation. If a man have slain<br></span>
<span class="i0">One only citizen, who leaves behind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Few interested to avenge his death,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, flying, he forsakes both friends and home;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But we have slain the noblest Princes far <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l140" id="BXXIII_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ithaca, on whom our city most<br></span>
<span class="i0">Depended; therefore, I advise thee, think!<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him, prudent, then answer’d Telemachus.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Be that thy care, my father! for report<br></span>
<span class="i0">Proclaims <i>thee</i> shrewdest of mankind, with whom<br></span>
<span class="i0">In ingenuity may none compare.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lead thou; to follow thee shall be our part<br></span>
<span class="i0">With prompt alacrity; nor shall, I judge,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Courage be wanting to our utmost force.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus then replied Ulysses, ever-wise. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l150" id="BXXIII_l150"></a>150</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To me the safest counsel and the best<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seems this. First wash yourselves, and put ye on<br></span>
<span class="i0">Your tunics; bid ye, next, the maidens take<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their best attire, and let the bard divine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Harping melodious play a sportive dance,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That, whether passenger or neighbour near,<br></span>
<span class="i0">All may imagine nuptials held within.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So shall not loud report that we have slain<br></span>
<span class="i0">All those, alarm the city, till we gain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our woods and fields, where, once arriv’d, such plans <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l160" id="BXXIII_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">We will devise, as Jove shall deign to inspire.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake, and all, obedient, in the bath<br></span>
<span class="i0">First laved themselves, then put their tunics on;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The damsels also dress’d, and the sweet bard,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Harping melodious, kindled strong desire<br></span>
<span class="i0">In all, of jocund song and graceful dance.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The palace under all its vaulted roof<br></span>
<span class="i0">Remurmur’d to the feet of sportive youths<br></span>
<span class="i0">And cinctured maidens, while no few abroad,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hearing such revelry within, remark’d— <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l170" id="BXXIII_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">The Queen with many wooers, weds at last.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ah fickle and unworthy fair! too frail<br></span>
<span class="i0">Always to keep inviolate the house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of her first Lord, and wait for his return.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake the people; but they little knew<br></span>
<span class="i0">What had befall’n. Eurynome, meantime,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With bath and unction serv’d the illustrious Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, and he saw himself attired<br></span>
<span class="i0">Royally once again in his own house.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, Pallas over all his features shed <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l180" id="BXXIII_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Superior beauty, dignified his form<br></span>
<span class="i0">With added amplitude, and pour’d his curls<br></span>
<span class="i0">Like hyacinthine flow’rs down from his brows.<br></span>
<span class="i0">As when some artist by Minerva made<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Vulcan, wise to execute all tasks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ingenious, borders silver with a wreath<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of gold, accomplishing a graceful work,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such grace the Goddess o’er his ample chest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Copious diffused, and o’er his manly brows.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He, godlike, stepping from the bath, resumed <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l190" id="BXXIII_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">His former seat magnificent, and sat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Opposite to the Queen, to whom he said.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Penelope! the Gods to thee have giv’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all thy sex, the most obdurate heart.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Another wife lives not who could endure<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such distance from her husband new-return’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To his own country in the twentieth year,<br></span>
<span class="i0">After such hardship. But prepare me, nurse,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A bed, for solitary I must sleep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Since she is iron, and feels not for me. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l200" id="BXXIII_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d then prudent Penelope.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I neither magnify thee, sir! nor yet<br></span>
<span class="i0">Depreciate thee, nor is my wonder such<br></span>
<span class="i0">As hurries me at once into thy arms,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Though my remembrance perfectly retains,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such as he was, Ulysses, when he sail’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">On board his bark from Ithaca—Go, nurse,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Prepare his bed, but not within the walls<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of his own chamber built with his own <a class="correction" title="changed from 'bands'" href="#tnotes">hands</a>.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Spread it without, and spread it well with warm <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l210" id="BXXIII_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Mantles, with fleeces, and with richest rugs.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake she, proving him,<a name="fnm_108" id="fnm_108"></a><a href="#fn_108" class="fnnum">108</a> and not untouch’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With anger at that word, thus he replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Penelope, that order grates my ear.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who hath displaced my bed? The task were hard<br></span>
<span class="i0">E’en to an artist; other than a God<br></span>
<span class="i0">None might with ease remove it; as for man,<br></span>
<span class="i0">It might defy the stoutest in his prime<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of youth, to heave it to a different spot.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For in that bed elaborate, a sign, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l220" id="BXXIII_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A special sign consists; I was myself<br></span>
<span class="i0">The artificer; I fashion’d it alone.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within the court a leafy olive grew<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lofty, luxuriant, pillar-like in girth.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Around this tree I built, with massy stones<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cemented close, my chamber, roof’d it o’er,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And hung the glutinated portals on.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I lopp’d the ample foliage and the boughs,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And sev’ring near the root its solid bole,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Smooth’d all the rugged stump with skilful hand, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l230" id="BXXIII_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And wrought it to a pedestal well squared<br></span>
<span class="i0">And modell’d by the line. I wimbled, next,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The frame throughout, and from the olive-stump<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beginning, fashion’d the whole bed above<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till all was finish’d, plated o’er with gold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With silver, and with ivory, and beneath<br></span>
<span class="i0">Close interlaced with purple cordage strong.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such sign I give thee. But if still it stand<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unmoved, or if some other, sev’ring sheer<br></span>
<span class="i0">The olive from its bottom, have displaced <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l240" id="BXXIII_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">My bed—that matter is best known to thee.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ceas’d; she, conscious of the sign so plain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Giv’n by Ulysses, heard with flutt’ring heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">And fault’ring knees that proof. Weeping she ran<br></span>
<span class="i0">Direct toward him, threw her arms around<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Hero, kiss’d his forehead, and replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ah my Ulysses! pardon me—frown not—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, who at other times hast ever shewn<br></span>
<span class="i0">Superior wisdom! all our griefs have flow’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">From the Gods’ will; they envied us the bliss <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l250" id="BXXIII_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of undivided union sweet enjoy’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Through life, from early youth to latest age.<br></span>
<span class="i0">No. Be not angry now; pardon the fault<br></span>
<span class="i0">That I embraced thee not as soon as seen,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For horror hath not ceased to overwhelm<br></span>
<span class="i0">My soul, lest some false alien should, perchance,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beguile me, for our house draws num’rous such.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Jove’s daughter, Argive Helen, ne’er had given<br></span>
<span class="i0">Free entertainment to a stranger’s love,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had she foreknown that the heroic sons <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l260" id="BXXIII_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Greece would bring her to her home again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But heav’n incited her to that offence,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who never, else, had even in her thought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Harbour’d the foul enormity, from which<br></span>
<span class="i0">Originated even our distress.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But now, since evident thou hast described<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our bed, which never mortal yet beheld,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ourselves except and Actoris my own<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attendant, giv’n me when I left my home<br></span>
<span class="i0">By good Icarius, and who kept the door, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l270" id="BXXIII_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Though hard to be convinced, at last I yield.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, she awaken’d in his soul<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pity and grief; and folding in his arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">His blameless consort beautiful, he wept.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Welcome as land appears to those who swim,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose gallant bark Neptune with rolling waves<br></span>
<span class="i0">And stormy winds hath sunk in the wide sea,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A mariner or two, perchance, escape<br></span>
<span class="i0">The foamy flood, and, swimming, reach the land,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Weary indeed, and with incrusted brine <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l280" id="BXXIII_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">All rough, but oh, how glad to climb the coast!<br></span>
<span class="i0">So welcome in her eyes Ulysses seem’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Around whose neck winding her snowy arms,<br></span>
<span class="i0">She clung as she would loose him never more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus had they wept till rosy-finger’d morn<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had found them weeping, but Minerva check’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Night’s almost finish’d course, and held, meantime,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The golden dawn close pris’ner in the Deep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forbidding her to lead her coursers forth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lampus and Phaëton that furnish light <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l290" id="BXXIII_l290"></a>290</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To all the earth, and join them to the yoke.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus, Ulysses to Penelope.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My love; we have not yet attain’d the close<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all our sufferings, but unmeasured toil<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arduous remains, which I must still atchieve.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For so the spirit of the Theban seer<br></span>
<span class="i0">Inform’d me, on that day, when to enquire<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of mine and of my people’s safe return<br></span>
<span class="i0">I journey’d down to Pluto’s drear abode.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But let us hence to bed, there to enjoy <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l300" id="BXXIII_l300"></a>300</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Tranquil repose. My love, make no delay.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d then prudent Penelope.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt to bed at whatsoever time<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy soul desires, since the immortal Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Give thee to me and to thy home again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, thou hast spoken from the seer of Thebes<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of arduous toils yet unperform’d; declare<br></span>
<span class="i0">What toils? Thou wilt disclose them, as I judge,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hereafter, and why not disclose them now?<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l310" id="BXXIII_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ah conversant with woe! why would’st thou learn<br></span>
<span class="i0">That tale? but I will tell it thee at large.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wilt not hear with joy, nor shall myself<br></span>
<span class="i0">With joy rehearse it; for he bade me seek<br></span>
<span class="i0">City after city, bearing, as I go,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A shapely oar, till I shall find, at length,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A people who the sea know not, nor eat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Food salted; they trim galley crimson-prow’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have ne’er beheld, nor yet smooth-shaven oar<br></span>
<span class="i0">With which the vessel wing’d scuds o’er the waves. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l320" id="BXXIII_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">He gave me also this authentic sign,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which I will tell thee. In what place soe’er<br></span>
<span class="i0">I chance to meet a trav’ler who shall name<br></span>
<span class="i0">The oar on my broad shoulder borne, a van;<a name="fnm_109" id="fnm_109"></a><a href="#fn_109" class="fnnum">109</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">He bade me, planting it on the same spot,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Worship the King of Ocean with a bull,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A ram, and a lascivious boar, then seek<br></span>
<span class="i0">My home again, and sacrifice at home<br></span>
<span class="i0">An hecatomb to the immortal Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Inhabitants of the expanse above. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l330" id="BXXIII_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">So shall I die, at length, the gentlest death<br></span>
<span class="i0">Remote from Ocean; it shall find me late,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In soft serenity of age, the Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of a blest people.—Thus he prophesied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d then Penelope discrete.<br></span>
<span class="i0">If heav’n appoint thee in old age a lot<br></span>
<span class="i0">More tranquil, hope thence springs of thy escape<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some future day from all thy threaten’d woes.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Such was their mutual conf’rence sweet; meantime<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eurynome and Euryclea dress’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l340" id="BXXIII_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Their bed by light of the clear torch, and when<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dispatchful they had spread it broad and deep,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Then came Eurynome, to whom in trust<br></span>

<span class="i1">At length, with conjugal endearment both<br></span>

<span class="i0">How to the isle of Æolus he came,<br></span>

<span class="i0">How, next he heard the Sirens in one strain <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l390" id="BXXIII_l390"></a>390</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">Detain’d, and fed, and promis’d him a life<br></span>
<span class="i0">Exempt for ever from the sap of age,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But him moved not. How, also, he arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">After much toil, on the Phæacian coast,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where ev’ry heart revered him as a God,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And whence, enriching him with brass and gold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And costly raiment first, they sent him home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At this last word, oblivious slumber sweet<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fell on him, dissipating all his cares. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l410" id="BXXIII_l410"></a>410</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Meantime, Minerva, Goddess azure-eyed,<br></span>

<span class="i0">And with sweet sleep, at once from Ocean rous’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The golden-axled chariot of the morn<br></span>
<span class="i0">To illumine earth. Then from his fleecy couch<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Hero sprang, and thus his spouse enjoined.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Oh consort dear! already we have striv’n<br></span>
<span class="i0">Against our lot, till wearied with the toil,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My painful absence, thou with ceaseless tears <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l420" id="BXXIII_l420"></a>420</span><br></span>

<span class="i0">All my domestic treasures, and ere long<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will replace my num’rous sheep destroy’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">By those imperious suitors, and the Greeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall add yet others till my folds be fill’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But to the woodlands go I now—to see <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIII_l430" id="BXXIII_l430"></a>430</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">My noble father, who for my sake mourns<br></span>

<span class="i0">I know thee wise, I give thee thus in charge.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sun no sooner shall ascend, than fame<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall wide divulge the deed that I have done,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slaying the suitors under my own roof.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, therefore, with thy maidens, sit retired<br></span>
<span class="i0">In thy own chamber at the palace-top,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor question ask, nor, curious, look abroad.<br></span>

<span class="i0">His shoulders, called Telemachus; he roused<br></span>

<span class="i0">All take their martial weapons in their hand.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not disobedient they, as he enjoin’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Put armour on, and issued from the gates<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses at their head. The earth was now<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enlighten’d, but Minerva them in haste<br></span>
<span class="i0">Led forth into the fields, unseen by all.<br></span>

The proof consisted in this—that the bed being attached
to the stump of an olive tree still rooted, was immovable, and Ulysses
having made it himself, no person present, he must needs be apprized of
the impossibility of her orders, if he were indeed Ulysses; accordingly,
this demonstration of his identity satisfies all her scruples.</p>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="argument">Mercury conducts the souls of the suitors down to Ades. Ulysses discovers
himself to Laertes, and quells, by the aid of Minerva, an insurrection of
the people resenting the death of the suitors.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now Cyllenian Hermes summon’d forth<br></span>
<span class="i0">The spirits of the suitors; waving wide<br></span>
<span class="i0">The golden wand of pow’r to seal all eyes<br></span>
<span class="i0">In slumber, and to ope them wide again,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He drove them gibb’ring down into the shades,<a name="fnm_111" id="fnm_111"></a><a href="#fn_111" class="fnnum">111</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">As when the bats within some hallow’d cave<br></span>
<span class="i0">Flit squeaking all around, for if but one<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fall from the rock, the rest all follow him,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In such connexion mutual they adhere,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So, after bounteous Mercury, the ghosts, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l10" id="BXXIV_l10"></a>10</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Troop’d downward gibb’ring all the dreary way.<a href="#fn_111" class="fnnum">111</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">The Ocean’s flood and the Leucadian rock,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Sun’s gate also and the land of Dreams<br></span>
<span class="i0">They pass’d, whence, next, into the meads they came<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Asphodel, by shadowy forms possess’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Simulars of the dead. They found the souls<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of brave Pelides there, and of his friend<br></span>
<span class="i0">Patroclus, of Antilochus renown’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And of the mightier Ajax, for his form<br></span>
<span class="i0">And bulk (Achilles sole except) of all <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l20" id="BXXIV_l20"></a>20</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The sons of the Achaians most admired.<br></span>
<span class="i0">These waited on Achilles. Then, appear’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The mournful ghost of Agamemnon, son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Atreus, compass’d by the ghosts of all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who shared his fate beneath Ægisthus’ roof,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And him the ghost of Peleus’ son bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Atrides! of all Heroes we esteem’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thee dearest to the Gods, for that thy sway<br></span>
<span class="i0">Extended over such a glorious host<br></span>
<span class="i0">At Ilium, scene of sorrow to the Greeks. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l30" id="BXXIV_l30"></a>30</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But Fate, whose ruthless force none may escape<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all who breathe, pursued thee from the first.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou should’st have perish’d full of honour, full<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of royalty, at Troy; so all the Greeks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had rais’d thy tomb, and thou hadst then bequeath’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Great glory to thy son; but Fate ordain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">A death, oh how deplorable! for thee.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Atrides’ spirit thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Blest son of Peleus, semblance of the Gods,<br></span>
<span class="i0">At Ilium, far from Argos, fall’n! for whom <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l40" id="BXXIV_l40"></a>40</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Contending, many a Trojan, many a Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Greece died also, while in eddies whelm’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of dust thy vastness spread the plain,<a name="fnm_112" id="fnm_112"></a><a href="#fn_112" class="fnnum">112</a> nor thee<br></span>
<span class="i0">The chariot aught or steed could int’rest more!<br></span>
<span class="i0">All day we waged the battle, nor at last<br></span>
<span class="i0">Desisted, but for tempests sent from Jove.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At length we bore into the Greecian fleet<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy body from the field; there, first, we cleansed<br></span>
<span class="i0">With tepid baths and oil’d thy shapely corse,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then placed thee on thy bier, while many a Greek <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l50" id="BXXIV_l50"></a>50</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Around thee wept, and shore his locks for thee.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy mother, also, hearing of thy death<br></span>
<span class="i0">With her immortal nymphs from the abyss<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arose and came; terrible was the sound<br></span>
<span class="i0">On the salt flood; a panic seized the Greeks,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And ev’ry warrior had return’d on board<br></span>
<span class="i0">That moment, had not Nestor, ancient Chief,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Illumed by long experience, interposed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His counsels, ever wisest, wisest proved<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then also, and he thus address’d the host. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l60" id="BXXIV_l60"></a>60</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Sons of Achaia; fly not; stay, ye Greeks!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thetis arrives with her immortal nymphs<br></span>
<span class="i0">From the abyss, to visit her dead son.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So he; and, by his admonition stay’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Greeks fled not. Then, all around thee stood<br></span>
<span class="i0">The daughters of the Ancient of the Deep,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mourning disconsolate; with heav’nly robes<br></span>
<span class="i0">They clothed thy corse, and all the Muses nine<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deplored thee in full choir with sweetest tones<br></span>
<span class="i0">Responsive, nor one Greecian hadst thou seen <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l70" id="BXXIV_l70"></a>70</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Dry-eyed, such grief the Muses moved in all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Full sev’nteen days we, day and night, deplored<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy death, both Gods in heav’n and men below,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, on the eighteenth day, we gave thy corse<br></span>
<span class="i0">Its burning, and fat sheep around thee slew<br></span>
<span class="i0">Num’rous, with many a pastur’d ox moon-horn’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">We burn’d thee clothed in vesture of the Gods,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With honey and with oil feeding the flames<br></span>
<span class="i0">Abundant, while Achaia’s Heroes arm’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both horse and foot, encompassing thy pile, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l80" id="BXXIV_l80"></a>80</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Clash’d on their shields, and deaf’ning was the din.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when the fires of Vulcan had at length<br></span>
<span class="i0">Consumed thee, at the dawn we stored thy bones<br></span>
<span class="i0">In unguent and in undiluted wine;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For Thetis gave to us a golden vase<br></span>
<span class="i0">Twin-ear’d, which she profess’d to have received<br></span>
<span class="i0">From Bacchus, work divine of Vulcan’s hand.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within that vase, Achilles, treasured lie<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thine and the bones of thy departed friend<br></span>
<span class="i0">Patroclus, but a sep’rate urn we gave <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l90" id="BXXIV_l90"></a>90</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To those of brave Antilochus, who most<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of all thy friends at Ilium shared thy love<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thy respect, thy friend Patroclus slain.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Around both urns we piled a noble tomb,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(We warriors of the sacred Argive host)<br></span>
<span class="i0">On a tall promontory shooting far<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into the spacious Hellespont, that all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who live, and who shall yet be born, may view<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy record, even from the distant waves.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, by permission from the Gods obtain’d, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l100" id="BXXIV_l100"></a>100</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To the Achaian Chiefs in circus met<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thetis appointed games. I have beheld<br></span>
<span class="i0">The burial rites of many an Hero bold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When, on the death of some great Chief, the youths<br></span>
<span class="i0">Girding their loins anticipate the prize,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But sight of those with wonder fill’d me most,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So glorious past all others were the games<br></span>
<span class="i0">By silver-footed Thetis giv’n for thee,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For thou wast ever favour’d of the Gods.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, hast thou not, Achilles! although dead, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l110" id="BXXIV_l110"></a>110</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Foregone thy glory, but thy fair report<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is universal among all mankind;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But, as for me, what recompense had I,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My warfare closed? for whom, at my return,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Jove framed such dire destruction by the hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of fell Ægisthus and my murth’ress wife.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus, mutual, they conferr’d; meantime approach’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Swift messenger of heav’n, the Argicide,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Conducting thither all the shades of those<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slain by Ulysses. At that sight amazed <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l120" id="BXXIV_l120"></a>120</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Both moved toward them. Agamemnon’s shade<br></span>
<span class="i0">Knew well Amphimedon, for he had been<br></span>
<span class="i0">Erewhile his father’s guest in Ithaca,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thus the spirit of Atreus’ son began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Amphimedon! by what disastrous chance,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Coœvals as ye seem, and of an air<br></span>
<span class="i0">Distinguish’d all, descend ye to the Deeps?<br></span>
<span class="i0">For not the chosen youths of a whole town<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should form a nobler band. Perish’d ye sunk<br></span>
<span class="i0">Amid vast billows and rude tempests raised <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l130" id="BXXIV_l130"></a>130</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">By Neptune’s pow’r? or on dry land through force<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of hostile multitudes, while cutting off<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beeves from the herd, or driving flocks away?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or fighting for your city and your wives?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Resolve me? I was once a guest of yours.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Remember’st not what time at your abode<br></span>
<span class="i0">With godlike Menelaus I arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That we might win Ulysses with his fleet<br></span>
<span class="i0">To follow us to Troy? scarce we prevail’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">At last to gain the city-waster Chief, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l140" id="BXXIV_l140"></a>140</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And, after all, consumed a whole month more<br></span>
<span class="i0">The wide sea traversing from side to side.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom the spirit of Amphimedon.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Illustrious Agamemnon, King of men!<br></span>
<span class="i0">All this I bear in mind, and will rehearse<br></span>
<span class="i0">The manner of our most disastrous end.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Believing brave Ulysses lost, we woo’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime his wife; she our detested suit<br></span>
<span class="i0">Would neither ratify nor yet refuse,<br></span>

<span class="i0">This novel stratagem, at last, devised.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beginning, in her own recess, a web<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of slend’rest thread, and of a length and breadth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unusual, thus the suitors she address’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Princes, my suitors! since the noble Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses is no more, enforce not yet<br></span>
<span class="i0">My nuptials; wait till I shall finish first<br></span>
<span class="i0">A fun’ral robe (lest all my threads decay)<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which for the ancient Hero I prepare,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laertes, looking for the mournful hour <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l160" id="BXXIV_l160"></a>160</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">When fate shall snatch him to eternal rest;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Else, I the censure dread of all my sex,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should he so wealthy, want at last a shroud.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So spake the Queen; we, unsuspicious all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With her request complied. Thenceforth, all day<br></span>
<span class="i0">She wove the ample web, and by the aid<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of torches ravell’d it again at night.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Three years she thus by artifice our suit<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eluded safe, but when the fourth arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the same season, after many moons <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l170" id="BXXIV_l170"></a>170</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And fleeting days, return’d, a damsel then<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of her attendants, conscious of the fraud,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reveal’d it, and we found her pulling loose<br></span>
<span class="i0">The splendid web. Thus, through constraint, at length,<br></span>
<span class="i0">She finish’d it, and in her own despight.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when the Queen produced, at length, her work<br></span>
<span class="i0">Finish’d, new-blanch’d, bright as the sun or moon,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then came Ulysses, by some adverse God<br></span>
<span class="i0">Conducted, to a cottage on the verge<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of his own fields, in which his swine-herd dwells; <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l180" id="BXXIV_l180"></a>180</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">There also the illustrious Hero’s son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arrived soon after, in his sable bark<br></span>
<span class="i0">From sandy Pylus borne; they, plotting both<br></span>
<span class="i0">A dreadful death for all the suitors, sought<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our glorious city, but Ulysses last,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And first Telemachus. The father came<br></span>
<span class="i0">Conducted by his swine-herd, and attired<br></span>
<span class="i0">In tatters foul; a mendicant he seem’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Time-worn, and halted on a staff. So clad,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And ent’ring on the sudden, he escaped <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l190" id="BXXIV_l190"></a>190</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">All knowledge even of our eldest there,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And we reviled and smote him; he although<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath his own roof smitten and reproach’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With patience suffer’d it awhile, but roused<br></span>
<span class="i0">By inspiration of Jove Ægis-arm’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">At length, in concert with his son convey’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To his own chamber his resplendent arms,<br></span>
<span class="i0">There lodg’d them safe, and barr’d the massy doors<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, in his subtlety he bade the Queen<br></span>
<span class="i0">A contest institute with bow and rings <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l200" id="BXXIV_l200"></a>200</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Between the hapless suitors, whence ensued<br></span>
<span class="i0">Slaughter to all. No suitor there had pow’r<br></span>
<span class="i0">To overcome the stubborn bow that mock’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">All our attempts; and when the weapon huge<br></span>
<span class="i0">At length was offer’d to Ulysses’ hands,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With clamour’d menaces we bade the swain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Withhold it from him, plead he as he might;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus alone with loud command,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Bade give it him, and the illustrious Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Receiving in his hand the bow, with ease <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l210" id="BXXIV_l210"></a>210</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Bent it, and sped a shaft through all the rings.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, springing to the portal steps, he pour’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">The arrows forth, peer’d terrible around,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pierced King Antinoüs, and, aiming sure<br></span>
<span class="i0">His deadly darts, pierced others after him,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till in one common carnage heap’d we lay.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Some God, as plain appear’d, vouchsafed them aid,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such ardour urged them, and with such dispatch<br></span>
<span class="i0">They slew us on all sides; hideous were heard<br></span>
<span class="i0">The groans of dying men fell’d to the earth <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l220" id="BXXIV_l220"></a>220</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With head-strokes rude, and the floor swam with blood.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such, royal Agamemnon! was the fate<br></span>
<span class="i0">By which we perish’d, all whose bodies lie<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unburied still, and in Ulysses’ house,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For tidings none have yet our friends alarm’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">And kindred, who might cleanse from sable gore<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our clotted wounds, and mourn us on the bier,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which are the rightful privilege of the dead.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d, then, the shade of Atreus’ son.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh happy offspring of Laertes! shrewd <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l230" id="BXXIV_l230"></a>230</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses! matchless valour thou hast shewn<br></span>
<span class="i0">Recov’ring thus thy wife; nor less appears<br></span>
<span class="i0">The virtue of Icarius’ daughter wise,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The chaste Penelope, so faithful found<br></span>
<span class="i0">To her Ulysses, husband of her youth.<br></span>
<span class="i0">His glory, by superior merit earn’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall never die, and the immortal Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall make Penelope a theme of song<br></span>
<span class="i0">Delightful in the ears of all mankind.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not such was Clytemnestra, daughter vile <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l240" id="BXXIV_l240"></a>240</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Tyndarus; she shed her husband’s blood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And shall be chronicled in song a wife<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of hateful memory, by whose offence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Even the virtuous of her sex are shamed.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus they, beneath the vaulted roof obscure<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Pluto’s house, conferring mutual stood.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Meantime, descending from the city-gates,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, by his son and by his swains<br></span>
<span class="i0">Follow’d, arrived at the delightful farm<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which old Laertes had with strenuous toil <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l250" id="BXXIV_l250"></a>250</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself long since acquired. There stood his house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Encompass’d by a bow’r in which the hinds<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who served and pleased him, ate, and sat, and slept.<br></span>
<span class="i0">An ancient woman, a Sicilian, dwelt<br></span>
<span class="i0">There also, who in that sequester’d spot<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attended diligent her aged Lord.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus Ulysses to his followers spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Haste now, and, ent’ring, slay ye of the swine<br></span>
<span class="i0">The best for our regale; myself, the while,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will prove my father, if his eye hath still <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l260" id="BXXIV_l260"></a>260</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Discernment of me, or if absence long<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have worn the knowledge of me from his mind.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said, and gave into his servants’ care<br></span>
<span class="i0">His arms; they swift proceeded to the house,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to the fruitful grove himself as swift<br></span>
<span class="i0">To prove his father. Down he went at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">Into the spacious garden-plot, but found<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Dolius there, nor any of his sons<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or servants; they were occupied elsewhere,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, with the ancient hind himself, employ’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l270" id="BXXIV_l270"></a>270</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Collecting thorns with which to fence the grove.<br></span>
<span class="i0">In that umbrageous spot he found alone<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laertes, with his hoe clearing a plant;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sordid his tunic was, with many a patch<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mended unseemly; leathern were his greaves,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thong-tied and also patch’d, a frail defence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Against sharp thorns, while gloves secured his hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">From briar-points, and on his head he bore<br></span>
<span class="i0">A goat-skin casque, nourishing hopeless woe.<br></span>
<span class="i0">No sooner then the Hero toil-inured <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l280" id="BXXIV_l280"></a>280</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Saw him age-worn and wretched, than he paused<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath a lofty pear-tree’s shade to weep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There standing much he mused, whether, at once,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Kissing and clasping in his arms his sire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To tell him all, by what means he had reach’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">His native country, or to prove him first.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At length, he chose as his best course, with words<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of seeming strangeness to accost his ear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, with that purpose, moved direct toward him.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He, stooping low, loosen’d the earth around <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l290" id="BXXIV_l290"></a>290</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">A garden-plant, when his illustrious son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now, standing close beside him, thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Old sir! thou art no novice in these toils<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of culture, but thy garden thrives; I mark<br></span>
<span class="i0">In all thy ground no plant, fig, olive, vine,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pear-tree or flow’r-bed suff’ring through neglect.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But let it not offend thee if I say<br></span>
<span class="i0">That thou neglect’st thyself, at the same time<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oppress’d with age, sun-parch’d and ill-attired.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not for thy inactivity, methinks, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l300" id="BXXIV_l300"></a>300</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy master slights thee thus, nor speaks thy form<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or thy surpassing stature servile aught<br></span>
<span class="i0">In thee, but thou resemblest more a King.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yes—thou resemblest one who, bathed and fed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should softly sleep; such is the claim of age.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But tell me true—for whom labourest thou,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And whose this garden? answer me beside,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For I would learn; have I indeed arrived<br></span>
<span class="i0">In Ithaca, as one whom here I met<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ev’n now assured me, but who seem’d a man <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l310" id="BXXIV_l310"></a>310</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Not overwise, refusing both to hear<br></span>
<span class="i0">My questions, and to answer when I ask’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Concerning one in other days my guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">And friend, if he have still his being here,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or have deceas’d and journey’d to the shades.<br></span>
<span class="i0">For I will tell thee; therefore mark. Long since<br></span>
<span class="i0">A stranger reach’d my house in my own land,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom I with hospitality receiv’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever sojourn’d foreigner with me<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom I lov’d more. He was by birth, he said, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l320" id="BXXIV_l320"></a>320</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ithacan, and Laertes claim’d his sire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Son of Arcesias. Introducing him<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath my roof, I entertain’d him well,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And proved by gifts his welcome at my board.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I gave him seven talents of wrought gold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A goblet, argent all, with flow’rs emboss’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Twelve single cloaks, twelve carpets, mantles twelve<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of brightest lustre, with as many vests,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And added four fair damsels, whom he chose<br></span>
<span class="i0">Himself, well born and well accomplish’d all. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l330" id="BXXIV_l330"></a>330</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Then thus his ancient sire weeping replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stranger! thou hast in truth attain’d the isle<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy enquiry, but it is possess’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">By a rude race, and lawless. Vain, alas!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Were all thy num’rous gifts; yet hadst thou found<br></span>
<span class="i0">Him living here in Ithaca, with gifts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Reciprocated he had sent thee hence,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Requiting honourably in his turn<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy hospitality. But give me quick<br></span>
<span class="i0">Answer and true. How many have been the years <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l340" id="BXXIV_l340"></a>340</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Since thy reception of that hapless guest<br></span>
<span class="i0">My son? for mine, my own dear son was he.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But him, far distant both from friends and home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Either the fishes of the unknown Deep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Have eaten, or wild beasts and fowls of prey,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor I, or she who bare him, was ordain’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">To bathe his shrouded body with our tears,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor his chaste wife, well-dow’r’d Penelope<br></span>
<span class="i0">To close her husband’s eyes, and to deplore<br></span>
<span class="i0">His doom, which is the privilege of the dead. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l350" id="BXXIV_l350"></a>350</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But tell me also thou, for I would learn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who art thou? whence? where born? and sprung from whom?<br></span>
<span class="i0">The bark in which thou and thy godlike friends<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arrived, where is she anchor’d on our coast?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or cam’st thou only passenger on board<br></span>
<span class="i0">Another’s bark, who landed thee and went?<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I will with all simplicity relate<br></span>
<span class="i0">What thou hast ask’d. Of Alybas am I,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where in much state I dwell, son of the rich <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l360" id="BXXIV_l360"></a>360</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Apheidas royal Polypemon’s son,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And I am named Eperitus; by storms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Driven from Sicily I have arrived,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And yonder, on the margin of the field<br></span>
<span class="i0">That skirts your city, I have moor’d my bark.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Five years have pass’d since thy Ulysses left,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unhappy Chief! my country; yet the birds<br></span>
<span class="i0">At his departure hovered on the right,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in that sign rejoicing, I dismiss’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Him thence rejoicing also, for we hoped <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l370" id="BXXIV_l370"></a>370</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To mix in social intercourse again,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to exchange once more pledges of love.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He spake; then sorrow as a sable cloud<br></span>
<span class="i0">Involved Laertes; gath’ring with both hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">The dust, he pour’d it on his rev’rend head<br></span>
<span class="i0">With many a piteous groan. Ulysses’ heart<br></span>
<span class="i0">Commotion felt, and his stretch’d nostrils throbb’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With agony close-pent, while fixt he eyed<br></span>
<span class="i0">His father; with a sudden force he sprang<br></span>
<span class="i0">Toward him, clasp’d, and kiss’d him, and exclaim’d. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l380" id="BXXIV_l380"></a>380</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">My father! I am he. Thou seest thy son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Absent these twenty years at last return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But bid thy sorrow cease; suspend henceforth<br></span>
<span class="i0">All lamentation; for I tell thee true,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(And the occasion bids me briefly tell thee)<br></span>
<span class="i0">I have slain all the suitors at my home,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And all their taunts and injuries avenged.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then answer thus Laertes quick return’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">If thou hast come again, and art indeed<br></span>
<span class="i0">My son Ulysses, give me then the proof <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l390" id="BXXIV_l390"></a>390</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Indubitable, that I may believe.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">View, first, the scar which with his iv’ry tusk<br></span>
<span class="i0">A wild boar gave me, when at thy command<br></span>
<span class="i0">And at my mother’s, to Autolycus<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her father, on Parnassus, I repair’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seeking the gifts which, while a guest of yours,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He promis’d should be mine. Accept beside<br></span>
<span class="i0">This proof. I will enum’rate all the trees<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which, walking with thee in this cultured spot <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l400" id="BXXIV_l400"></a>400</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">(Boy then) I begg’d, and thou confirm’dst my own.<br></span>
<span class="i0">We paced between them, and thou mad’st me learn<br></span>
<span class="i0">The name of each. Thou gav’st me thirteen pears,<a name="fnm_113" id="fnm_113"></a><a href="#fn_113" class="fnnum">113</a><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ten apples,<a href="#fn_113" class="fnnum">113</a> thirty figs,<a href="#fn_113" class="fnnum">113</a> and fifty ranks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Didst promise me of vines, their alleys all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Corn-cropp’d between. There, oft as sent from Jove<br></span>
<span class="i0">The influences of the year descend,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grapes of all hues and flavours clust’ring hang.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said; Laertes, conscious of the proofs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Indubitable by Ulysses giv’n, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l410" id="BXXIV_l410"></a>410</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">With fault’ring knees and fault’ring heart both arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Around him threw. The Hero toil-inured<br></span>
<span class="i0">Drew to his bosom close his fainting sire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, breath recov’ring, and his scatter’d pow’rs<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of intellect, at length thus spake aloud.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Ye Gods! oh then your residence is still<br></span>
<span class="i0">On the Olympian heights, if punishment<br></span>
<span class="i0">At last hath seized on those flagitious men.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But terrour shakes me, lest, incensed, ere long<br></span>
<span class="i0">All Ithaca flock hither, and dispatch <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l420" id="BXXIV_l420"></a>420</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Swift messengers with these dread tidings charged<br></span>
<span class="i0">To ev’ry Cephallenian state around.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Him answer’d then Ulysses ever-wise.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Courage! fear nought, but let us to the house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the garden, whither I have sent<br></span>
<span class="i0">Telemachus, the herdsman, and the good<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eumæus to prepare us quick repast.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So they conferr’d, and to Laertes’ house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pass’d on together; there arrived, they found<br></span>
<span class="i0">Those three preparing now their plenteous feast, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l430" id="BXXIV_l430"></a>430</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And mingling sable wine; then, by the hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of his Sicilian matron, the old King<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was bathed, anointed, and attired afresh,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Pallas, drawing nigh, dilated more<br></span>
<span class="i0">His limbs, and gave his whole majestic form<br></span>
<span class="i0">Encrease of amplitude. He left the bath.<br></span>
<span class="i0">His son, amazed as he had seen a God<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alighted newly from the skies, exclaim’d.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My father! doubtless some immortal Pow’r<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath clothed thy form with dignity divine. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l440" id="BXXIV_l440"></a>440</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Then thus replied his venerable sire.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Jove! Pallas! Phœbus! oh that I possess’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such vigour now, as when in arms I took<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nericus, continental city fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With my brave Cephallenians! oh that such<br></span>
<span class="i0">And arm’d as then, I yesterday had stood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beside thee in thy palace, combating<br></span>
<span class="i0">Those suitors proud, then had I strew’d the floor<br></span>
<span class="i0">With num’rous slain, to thy exceeding joy.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Such was their conference; and now, the task <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l450" id="BXXIV_l450"></a>450</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of preparation ended, and the feast<br></span>
<span class="i0">Set forth, on couches and on thrones they sat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, ranged in order due, took each his share.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, ancient Dolius, and with him, his sons<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arrived toil-worn, by the Sicilian dame<br></span>
<span class="i0">Summon’d, their cat’ress, and their father’s kind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attendant ever in his eve of life.<br></span>
<span class="i0">They, seeing and recalling soon to mind<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, in the middle mansion stood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wond’ring, when thus Ulysses with a voice <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l460" id="BXXIV_l460"></a>460</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of some reproof, but gentle, them bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Old servant, sit and eat, banishing fear<br></span>
<span class="i0">And mute amazement; for, although provoked<br></span>
<span class="i0">By appetite, we have long time abstain’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Expecting ev’ry moment thy return.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said; then Dolius with expanded arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sprang right toward Ulysses, seized his hand,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Kiss’d it, and in wing’d accents thus replied.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Oh master ever dear! since thee the Gods<br></span>
<span class="i0">Themselves in answer to our warm desires, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l470" id="BXXIV_l470"></a>470</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Have, unexpectedly, at length restored,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hail, and be happy, and heav’n make thee such!<br></span>
<span class="i0">But say, and truly; knows the prudent Queen<br></span>
<span class="i0">Already thy return, or shall we send<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ourselves an herald with the joyful news?<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My ancient friend, thou may’st release thy mind<br></span>
<span class="i0">From that solicitude; she knows it well.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So he; then Dolius to his glossy seat<br></span>
<span class="i0">Return’d, and all his sons gath’ring around <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l480" id="BXXIV_l480"></a>480</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses, welcom’d him and grasp’d his hand,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then sat beside their father; thus beneath<br></span>
<span class="i0">Laertes’ roof they, joyful, took repast.<br></span>
<span class="i1">But Fame with rapid haste the city roam’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">In ev’ry part, promulging in all ears<br></span>
<span class="i0">The suitors’ horrid fate. No sooner heard<br></span>
<span class="i0">The multitude that tale, than one and all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Groaning they met and murmuring before<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses’ gates. Bringing the bodies forth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They buried each his friend, but gave the dead <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l490" id="BXXIV_l490"></a>490</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of other cities to be ferried home<br></span>
<span class="i0">By fishermen on board their rapid barks.<br></span>
<span class="i0">All hasted then to council; sorrow wrung<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their hearts, and, the assembly now convened,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arising first Eupithes spake, for grief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sat heavy on his soul, grief for the loss<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of his Antinoüs by Ulysses slain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Foremost of all, whom mourning, thus he said.<br></span>
<span class="i1">My friends! no trivial fruits the Greecians reap<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of this man’s doings. <i>Those</i> he took with him <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l500" id="BXXIV_l500"></a>500</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">On board his barks, a num’rous train and bold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then lost his barks, lost all his num’rous train,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>these</i>, our noblest, slew at his return.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Come therefore—ere he yet escape by flight<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Pylus or to noble Elis, realm<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Epeans, follow him; else shame<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attends us and indelible reproach.<br></span>
<span class="i0">If we avenge not on these men the blood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of our own sons and brothers, farewell then<br></span>
<span class="i0">All that makes life desirable; my wish <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l510" id="BXXIV_l510"></a>510</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Henceforth shall be to mingle with the shades.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh then pursue and seize them ere they fly.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thus he with tears, and pity moved in all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, Medon and the sacred bard whom sleep<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had lately left, arriving from the house<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Laertiades, approach’d; amid<br></span>
<span class="i0">The throng they stood; all wonder’d seeing them,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Medon, prudent senior, thus began.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Hear me, my countrymen! Ulysses plann’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">With no disapprobation of the Gods <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l520" id="BXXIV_l520"></a>520</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The deed that ye deplore. I saw, myself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A Pow’r immortal at the Hero’s side,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In semblance just of Mentor; now the God,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In front apparent, led him on, and now,<br></span>
<span class="i0">From side to side of all the palace, urged<br></span>
<span class="i0">To flight the suitors; heaps on heaps they fell.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He said; then terrour wan seiz’d ev’ry cheek,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Halitherses, Hero old, the son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Mastor, who alone among them all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Knew past, and future, prudent, thus began. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l530" id="BXXIV_l530"></a>530</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Now, O ye men of Ithaca! my words<br></span>
<span class="i0">Attentive hear! by your own fault, my friends,<br></span>
<span class="i0">This deed hath been perform’d; for when myself<br></span>
<span class="i0">And noble Mentor counsell’d you to check<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sin and folly of your sons, ye would not.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Great was their wickedness, and flagrant wrong<br></span>
<span class="i0">They wrought, the wealth devouring and the wife<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dishonouring of an illustrious Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom they deem’d destined never to return.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But hear my counsel. Go not, lest ye draw <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l540" id="BXXIV_l540"></a>540</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Disaster down and woe on your own heads.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended; then with boist’rous roar (although<br></span>
<span class="i0">Part kept their seats) upsprang the multitude,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For Halitherses pleased them not, they chose<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eupithes’ counsel rather; all at once<br></span>
<span class="i0">To arms they flew, and clad in dazzling brass<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before the city form’d their dense array.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Leader infatuate at their head appear’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eupithes, hoping to avenge his son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Antinoüs, but was himself ordain’d <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l550" id="BXXIV_l550"></a>550</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To meet his doom, and to return no more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus Minerva to Saturnian Jove.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Oh father! son of Saturn! Jove supreme!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Declare the purpose hidden in thy breast.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou that this hostility proceed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or wilt thou grant them amity again?<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom the cloud-assembler God replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Why asks my daughter? didst thou not design<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thyself, that brave Ulysses coming home<br></span>
<span class="i0">Should slay those profligates? act as thou wilt, <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l560" id="BXXIV_l560"></a>560</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But thus I counsel, since the noble Chief<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hath slain the suitors, now let peace ensue<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oath-bound, and reign Ulysses evermore!<br></span>
<span class="i0">The slaughter of their brethren and their sons<br></span>
<span class="i0">To strike from their remembrance, shall be ours.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Let mutual amity, as at the first,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unite them, and let wealth and peace abound.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, he animated to her task<br></span>
<span class="i0">Minerva prompt before, and from the heights<br></span>
<span class="i0">Olympian down to Ithaca she flew. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l570" id="BXXIV_l570"></a>570</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime Ulysses (for their hunger now<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thirst were sated) thus address’d his hinds.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Look ye abroad, lest haply they approach.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He said, and at his word, forth went a son<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Dolius; at the gate he stood, and thence<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beholding all that multitude at hand,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In accents wing’d thus to Ulysses spake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">They come—they are already arrived—arm all!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then, all arising, put their armour on,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses with his three, and the six sons <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l580" id="BXXIV_l580"></a>580</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Dolius; Dolius also with the rest,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arm’d and Laertes, although silver-hair’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Warriors perforce. When all were clad alike<br></span>
<span class="i0">In radiant armour, throwing wide the gates<br></span>
<span class="i0">They sallied, and Ulysses led the way.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then Jove’s own daughter Pallas, in the form<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with the voice of Mentor, came in view,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom seeing Laertiades rejoiced,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thus Telemachus, his son, bespake.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Now, oh my son! thou shalt observe, untold <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l590" id="BXXIV_l590"></a>590</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">By me, where fight the bravest. Oh shame not<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thine ancestry, who have in all the earth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Proof given of valour in all ages past.<br></span>
<span class="i1">To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My father! if thou wish that spectacle,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt behold thy son, as thou hast said,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In nought dishonouring his noble race.<br></span>
<span class="i1">Then was Laertes joyful, and exclaim’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">What sun hath ris’n to-day?<a name="fnm_114" id="fnm_114"></a><a href="#fn_114" class="fnnum">114</a> oh blessed Gods!<br></span>
<span class="i0">My son and grandson emulous dispute <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l600" id="BXXIV_l600"></a>600</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The prize of glory, and my soul exults.<br></span>
<span class="i1">He ended, and Minerva drawing nigh<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the old King, thus counsell’d him. Oh friend<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom most I love, son of Arcesias! pray’r<br></span>
<span class="i0">Preferring to the virgin azure-eyed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to her father Jove, delay not, shake<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy lance in air, and give it instant flight.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, the Goddess nerved his arm anew.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He sought in pray’r the daughter dread of Jove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, brandishing it, hurl’d his lance; it struck <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l610" id="BXXIV_l610"></a>610</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Eupithes, pierced his helmet brazen-cheek’d<br></span>
<span class="i0">That stay’d it not, but forth it sprang beyond,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with loud clangor of his arms he fell.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then flew Ulysses and his noble son<br></span>
<span class="i0">With faulchion and with spear of double edge<br></span>
<span class="i0">To the assault, and of them all had left<br></span>
<span class="i0">None living, none had to his home return’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But that Jove’s virgin daughter with a voice<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of loud authority thus quell’d them all.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Peace, O ye men of Ithaca! while yet <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l620" id="BXXIV_l620"></a>620</span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The field remains undeluged with your blood.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So she, and fear at once paled ev’ry cheek.<br></span>
<span class="i0">All trembled at the voice divine; their arms<br></span>
<span class="i0">Escaping from the grasp fell to the earth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, covetous of longer life, each fled<br></span>
<span class="i0">Back to the city. Then Ulysses sent<br></span>
<span class="i0">His voice abroad, and with an eagle’s force<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sprang on the people; but Saturnian Jove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cast down, incontinent, his smouldring bolt<br></span>
<span class="i0">At Pallas’ feet, and thus the Goddess spake. <span class="linenum"><a name="BXXIV_l630" id="BXXIV_l630"></a>630</span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Laertes’ noble son, for wiles renown’d!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forbear; abstain from slaughter; lest thyself<br></span>
<span class="i0">Incur the anger of high thund’ring Jove.<br></span>
<span class="i1">So Pallas, whom Ulysses, glad, obey’d.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then faithful covenants of peace between<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both sides ensued, ratified in the sight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of Pallas progeny of Jove, who seem’d,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In voice and form, the Mentor known to all.<br></span>

<h2><a name="NOTES" id="NOTES"></a>NOTES</h2>

<h4>NOTE I.</h4>

<p><a href="#BX_l100">Bk. x. l. 101-106</a> (Hom. x. l. 81-86).—It is held now that this passage
should be explained by the supposition that the Homeric bards had heard
tales of northern latitudes, where, in summer-time, the darkness was so
short that evening was followed almost at once by morning. Thus the
herdsman coming home in the twilight at one day’s close might meet and
hail the shepherd who was starting betimes for the next day’s work.</p>

<p>Line 86 in the Greek ought probably to be translated, “For the paths of
night and day are close together,” <i>i.e.</i>, the entrance of day follows
hard on the entrance of night.</p>

<h4>NOTE II.</h4>

<p><a href="#BXI_l160">Bk. xi. l. 162, 163</a> (Hom. xi. l. 134, 135).—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10"><span class="translit" title="thanatos de toi ex halos autôi">θάνατος δέ τοι ἐξ ἁλὸς αὐτῷ</span><br></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="translit" title="ablêchros mala toios eleusetai"><a href="#tnotes" class="correction" title="changed from 'ἀβληχρός'">ἀβληχρὸς</a> μάλα τοῖος ἐλεύσεται</span>.<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>Others translate, “And from the sea shall thy own death come,” suggesting
that Ulysses after all was lost at sea. This is the rendering followed by
Tennyson in his poem “Ulysses” (and see Dante, <i>Inferno</i>, Canto xxvi.).
It is a more natural translation of the Greek, and gives a far more
wonderful vista for the close of the Wanderer’s life.</p>

<h4>NOTE III.</h4>

<p><a href="#BXIX_l710">Bk. xix. l. 712</a> (Hom. xix. l. 573).—The word <span class="translit" title="pelekeas">πελέκεας</span>, for which Cowper
gives as a paraphrase “spikes, crested with a ring,” elsewhere means
<i>axes</i>, and ought so to be translated here. For since Cowper’s day an
axe-head of the Mycenæan period has been discovered <i>with the blade
pierced</i> so as to form a hole through which an arrow could pass. (See
Tsountas and Manatt, <i>The Mycenæan Age</i>.) Axes of this type were not
known to Cowper, and hence the hypothesis in his text. He realised
correctly the essential conditions of the feat proposed: the axes must
have been set up, one behind the other, in the way he suggested for his
ringed stakes.</p>

<h4>NOTE IV.</h4>

<p><a href="#BXXII_l130">Bk. xxii. l. 139-162</a> (Hom. xxii. l. 126-143).—How Melanthius got out of
the hall remains a puzzle. Cowper assumes a second postern, but there is
no evidence for this, and l. 139 ff. (l. 126 ff. in the Greek)
suggest rather strongly that there was only <i>one</i>. Unfortunately, the crucial
word <span class="translit" title="rhôges">ῥῶγες</span> which occurs in the line describing Melanthius’ exit is not
found elsewhere. “He went up,” the poet says, “through the <span class="translit" title="rhôges">ῥῶγες</span> of the
hall.” Merry suggests that “he scrambled up to the loopholes that were
pierced in the wall.” Others suppose that there was a ladder at the inner
end of the hall leading to the upper story, and on through passages to
the armoury.</p>

<p>In l. 141 (l. 128 in the Greek) the word translated “street” by Cowper is
usually rendered “corridor.”</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement

agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

<div style="display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
